However, since coming out of stealth in July, Metropolis have managed to sell out two NFT drops in a matter of hours, both of which topped Open Sea. They are the first city to be covered by <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/metropolis\">Time Out </a>and boast prominent “Founding Citizens” from across the Web3 and Arts and Culture space, including Steve Aoki, Bored Elon, and Dillon Francis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graduates of <a href=\"https://outlierventures.io/meet-our-filecoin-base-camp-2-cohort/\">Q2 2022’s Filecoin Base Camp</a>, Metropolis came into Base Camp having raised a substantial Pre-Seed round. They went on to raise a successful Seed round and build a world-class product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Metropolis stand out among metaverses is chiefly the team’s dedication to their original purpose and vision—a Metaverse that truly feels real and enjoyable. Celeste, Metropolis’ genesis is meant to be as dynamic and vibrant as real cities; that feels alive and draws people in. At Outlier Ventures (OV), we’re confident that projects like Metropolis are essential building blocks for the open Metaverse.&nbsp; They weave together the fabrics of tech, arts, and finance while giving power to community members, which are essential building blocks for the Open Metaverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A strong team</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded by Lebanese-British siblings Rania and Rashid Ajami, the idea of Metropolis draws heavily on the co-founders’ professional and personal experience. Chief Creative Officer (CCO) <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rania-ajami-7457452/\">Rania Ajami</a> has years of experience creating award-winning off-broadway immersive theater productions, namely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip%27s_Island\">Pip’s Island</a>. CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashid-ajami-55633940/\">Rashid Ajami</a> has previously toured the world as a house and techno DJ, leveraging his network to onboard prominent DJ’s, including 3Lau, Dillon Francis and Steve Aoki, as founding citizens. Much like Rania, Rashid is also a serial entrepreneur having started <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/campus-society\">Campus Society</a>, a social network for University students that has grown to over one million users. The founding team also consists of Creative Producer <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-athey-757378161/\">Jeff Athey</a> (a performance artist) CTO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jobyi/?originalSubdomain=gg\">Joby Ingram-Dodd,</a> (an entrepreneur with a background in AI engineering) and Head of Community Zack Hinson, who has years of experience building Web3 communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Altogether, the well-rounded and complimentary experience of the founding team made OV confident that they were the right team to pull off a creative project of this magnitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A quality product</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Metropolis is a prime example of quality and meticulous product design. With a background in film and television, Rania and Jeff made sure every corner of the world, from buildings, to artifacts and the characters, has a unique story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“People are constantly launching all these supposed Metaverse things, and none of them have left us that inspired,” says Rania. “Our emphasis on quality content attracts really cool people to our ecosystem, a place people would want to go and interact with and play in and just wander around.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That attention to detail results in a Metaverse populated with truly unique attributes, rather than streets filled with copied-and-pasted buildings or one-note avatars. Metropolis is a space with new experiences around every corner. It is a place where there’s always something new to discover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/metropolisworld/what-the-metaverse-needs-an-oasis-in-the-technological-desert-753ef9de5a78\">&lt;What the Metaverse needs: an oasis in the technological desert&gt;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this sense, Metropolis takes inspiration from cities like London, New York, and Paris. “What is it that makes an incredible city? It&#8217;s the beauty of the architecture, it&#8217;s the community that inhabits those buildings. It&#8217;s the content that you can experience. It&#8217;s the marketplace, where you can spend and trade. It&#8217;s the immersion,” Rania explains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Web2 to Web3</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Convenience and problem-solving are often at the core of any startup’s mission.

However, since coming out of stealth in July, Metropolis have managed to sell out two NFT drops in a matter of hours, both of which topped Open Sea. They are the first city to be covered by Time Out and boast prominent “Founding Citizens” from across the Web3 and Arts and Culture space, including Steve Aoki, Bored Elon, and Dillon Francis.\nGraduates of Q2 2022’s Filecoin Base Camp, Metropolis came into Base Camp having raised a substantial Pre-Seed round. They went on to raise a successful Seed round and build a world-class product.\nWhat makes Metropolis stand out among metaverses is chiefly the team’s dedication to their original purpose and vision—a Metaverse that truly feels real and enjoyable. Celeste, Metropolis’ genesis is meant to be as dynamic and vibrant as real cities; that feels alive and draws people in. At Outlier Ventures (OV), we’re confident that projects like Metropolis are essential building blocks for the open Metaverse.  They weave together the fabrics of tech, arts, and finance while giving power to community members, which are essential building blocks for the Open Metaverse.\nA strong team\nFounded by Lebanese-British siblings Rania and Rashid Ajami, the idea of Metropolis draws heavily on the co-founders’ professional and personal experience. Chief Creative Officer (CCO) Rania Ajami has years of experience creating award-winning off-broadway immersive theater productions, namely Pip’s Island. CEO Rashid Ajami has previously toured the world as a house and techno DJ, leveraging his network to onboard prominent DJ’s, including 3Lau, Dillon Francis and Steve Aoki, as founding citizens. Much like Rania, Rashid is also a serial entrepreneur having started Campus Society, a social network for University students that has grown to over one million users. The founding team also consists of Creative Producer Jeff Athey (a performance artist) CTO Joby Ingram-Dodd, (an entrepreneur with a background in AI engineering) and Head of Community Zack Hinson, who has years of experience building Web3 communities.\nAltogether, the well-rounded and complimentary experience of the founding team made OV confident that they were the right team to pull off a creative project of this magnitude.\nA quality product\nMetropolis is a prime example of quality and meticulous product design. With a background in film and television, Rania and Jeff made sure every corner of the world, from buildings, to artifacts and the characters, has a unique story.\n“People are constantly launching all these supposed Metaverse things, and none of them have left us that inspired,” says Rania. “Our emphasis on quality content attracts really cool people to our ecosystem, a place people would want to go and interact with and play in and just wander around.”\nThat attention to detail results in a Metaverse populated with truly unique attributes, rather than streets filled with copied-and-pasted buildings or one-note avatars. Metropolis is a space with new experiences around every corner. It is a place where there’s always something new to discover.\n<What the Metaverse needs: an oasis in the technological desert>\nIn this sense, Metropolis takes inspiration from cities like London, New York, and Paris. “What is it that makes an incredible city? It’s the beauty of the architecture, it’s the community that inhabits those buildings. It’s the content that you can experience. It’s the marketplace, where you can spend and trade. It’s the immersion,” Rania explains.\nWeb2 to Web3\nConvenience and problem-solving are often at the core of any startup’s mission. For companies that want to encourage mainstream adoption of Web3, accessibility and ease of use will be key factors for any product to succeed and outshine competitors.\nMetropolis avoids jargon and technical concepts as much as possible.
