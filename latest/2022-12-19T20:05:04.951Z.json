Assessing the health of communities, whether digital or analog or both, is difficult work requiring responsible data collection and analysis across multiple media. There must be quality data gathered from enough sources over a sufficient amount of time to provide meaningful results — which can then drive insightful analysis and decision-making that create measurably positive outcomes (many of these terms themselves require definition). RnDAO is seeking to explore this and build tools that facilitate and improve collaboration. The team has previously partnered with various organizations, including Aave, Aragon, and MetaGame, to create frameworks and tooling to support their goal of &quot;empowering humane collaboration” — which is what they hope to accomplish through this proposal to Cosmos. As Daniel writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“the lack of real-time analytics leaves DAO community leaders and members without established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused initiatives, identify best practices, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes (such as market crashes, protocol migrations, etc.).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-proposal-community-health-research-analytics-and-benchmarking\">The Proposal: Community Health research, analytics, and benchmarking</h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/90\">this proposal</a> to the Cosmos community, RnDAO asks for the equivalent of $30k in ATOM to fund research and tooling to do the following (as stated in the proposal):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>develop a framework for Community Health with actionable metrics</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>create an open-source data collection tool</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>implement the tool in Cosmos Hub and others</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>analyze the interactions and perceptions data to validate the framework and provide insights to advance the Cosmos community.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>RnDAO has a team of two PhDs in network science and a network designer ready to undertake the project with Cosmos, and they plan to begin with two specific approaches. The first is to use Organizational Network Analysis (ONA), which is described as “a structured way to visualize how communications, information, and value creation occur through an organization based on interaction graphs” — and is thought to be an improvement over traditional surveys. Second, they plan to use Pulse Surveys, which are “frequent and automated micro-surveys” to be administered via Discord. The data collected will be anonymized before analysis. The ultimate deliverable is a Community Health Report, which includes the conceptual framework, data collection tools, and key performance indicators — as well as “actionable insights” to improve community health. Delivery of the Community Health Report, to be presented alongside a workshop, will take place no longer than seven weeks after the grant has been received. A continuing engagement with RnDAO might be considered if the work proves valuable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D0_CfDZEPDdFakWCHv9Hv.png?height=1582&width=2036\" alt=\"Community Health research, analytics and benchmarking\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-vote-on-chain-community-health-research-analytics-and-benchmarking/7435\">Response</a> to the proposal has been strong but mixed.
