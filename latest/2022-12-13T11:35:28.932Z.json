His SECRET is, when asked pointed questions, he switches to market-plumbing speak, hiding behind lingo.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Let me help you understand SBF's moves.</p>\n  <p>:thread: :point_down:</p>\n  <p>\\</p>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Anytime you hear or read \"Alameda,\" replace with, \"Sam's personal account.\"</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  When Alameda borrows FTX customer money, that means \"Sam borrows customer money\": Alameda is 100% owned by Sam &amp; a few friends. Alameda had no clients. \"Alameda's capital\" is Sam's, Caroline's, etc.</p>\n  <p>:point_down:</p>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>Sam says he poorly \"risk-managed\" the FTX and Alameda relationship.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  Recall: Alameda=Sam. What transpired?</p>\n  <p>\\\n  ‚Ä¢ Alameda (Sam) Had Liquidity Issues</p>\n  <p>\\\n  ‚Ä¢ Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX</p>\n  <p>\\\n  ‚Ä¢ To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX</p>\n  <p>\\\n  ‚Ä¢ The Collateral Was Pretend Money</p>\n  <p>\\\n  3) Alameda (Sam) Had Issues:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Nobody has nailed down what happened: was Alameda *always* a fraud or did it suffer losses at some point and then get desperate (perhaps the Terra Luna implosion in the spring)?</p>\n  <p>\\\n  This is a question begging for an answer. I don't know, but‚Ä¶</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true\">https://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4)‚Ä¶Sam claims he was no longer closely involved in Alameda (again, Alameda = Sam's personal capital). Sam claims Caroline &amp; Team ran it independently (other than its venture investments).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  This claim gives Sam cover to state he doesn't know the details about Alameda's issues.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  5) Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  At some point - time uncertain - Alameda (Sam) needed access to liquidity. It almost certainly had margin loans from 3rd parties being called (3rd parties like Gemini or Binance‚Ä¶maybe FTX?). To repay these, Alameda needed liquidity.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  6) To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  FTX client assets were the liquidity that Alameda (Sam) needed to repay its other loans. To pretend this was OK, FTX needed to hold collateral from Alameda as security against the loan (in case Alameda (Sam) didn't repay).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  7) When you borrow cash on margin, you generally have to post MORE collateral than you borrow.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Ex: you might borrow against your Schwab account. Schwab holds your account's assets as protection against you defaulting on the loan. This lets you turn investments into liquidity.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  8) Elon's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> margin loan is a prominent example:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of TSLA stock he posts (giving him cash to do anything, like buy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TWTR&src=cashtag_click\">$TWTR</a>, without selling TSLA).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  After borrowing from the facility, if TSLA stock falls below a certain threshold (say $1 to $3)‚Ä¶</p>\n  <p>\\\n  9)‚Ä¶Elon needs to either add more collateral to the margin facility (post more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a>) or pay down the loan.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  If he does neither, the lender can liquidate the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> it holds as collateral and repay the loan from the proceeds.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Now back to Alameda (Sam)‚Ä¶</p>\n  <p>\\\n  10) Together, FTX &amp; Alameda (Sam &amp; Sam) developed a few shitcoins‚Ä¶err \"tokens\": the most relevant are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a>.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Both FTX &amp; Alameda received huge grants of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a> (I'm just going to use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> going forward).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  F&amp;A (Sam) controlled the VAST majority of the issuance‚Ä¶</p>\n  <p>\\\n  11)‚Ä¶and only a tiny portion of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a> traded.

His SECRET is, when asked pointed questions, he switches to market-plumbing speak, hiding behind lingo.\n\\\n  Let me help you understand SBF's moves.\n:thread: :point_down:\n\\\n  \nAnytime you hear or read \"Alameda,\" replace with, \"Sam's personal account.\"\n\\\n  When Alameda borrows FTX customer money, that means \"Sam borrows customer money\": Alameda is 100% owned by Sam & a few friends. Alameda had no clients. \"Alameda's capital\" is Sam's, Caroline's, etc.\n:point_down:\nSam says he poorly \"risk-managed\" the FTX and Alameda relationship.\n\\\n  Recall: Alameda=Sam. What transpired?\n\\\n  ‚Ä¢ Alameda (Sam) Had Liquidity Issues\n\\\n  ‚Ä¢ Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX\n\\\n  ‚Ä¢ To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX\n\\\n  ‚Ä¢ The Collateral Was Pretend Money\n\\\n  3) Alameda (Sam) Had Issues:\n\\\n  Nobody has nailed down what happened: was Alameda *always* a fraud or did it suffer losses at some point and then get desperate (perhaps the Terra Luna implosion in the spring)?\n\\\n  This is a question begging for an answer. I don't know, but‚Ä¶\nhttps://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true\n4)‚Ä¶Sam claims he was no longer closely involved in Alameda (again, Alameda = Sam's personal capital). Sam claims Caroline & Team ran it independently (other than its venture investments).\n\\\n  This claim gives Sam cover to state he doesn't know the details about Alameda's issues.\n\\\n  5) Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX:\n\\\n  At some point - time uncertain - Alameda (Sam) needed access to liquidity. It almost certainly had margin loans from 3rd parties being called (3rd parties like Gemini or Binance‚Ä¶maybe FTX?). To repay these, Alameda needed liquidity.\n\\\n  6) To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX:\n\\\n  FTX client assets were the liquidity that Alameda (Sam) needed to repay its other loans. To pretend this was OK, FTX needed to hold collateral from Alameda as security against the loan (in case Alameda (Sam) didn't repay).\n\\\n  7) When you borrow cash on margin, you generally have to post MORE collateral than you borrow.\n\\\n  Ex: you might borrow against your Schwab account. Schwab holds your account's assets as protection against you defaulting on the loan. This lets you turn investments into liquidity.\n\\\n  8) Elon's $TSLA margin loan is a prominent example:\n\\\n  Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of TSLA stock he posts (giving him cash to do anything, like buy $TWTR, without selling TSLA).\n\\\n  After borrowing from the facility, if TSLA stock falls below a certain threshold (say $1 to $3)‚Ä¶\n\\\n  9)‚Ä¶Elon needs to either add more collateral to the margin facility (post more $TSLA) or pay down the loan.\n\\\n  If he does neither, the lender can liquidate the $TSLA it holds as collateral and repay the loan from the proceeds.\n\\\n  Now back to Alameda (Sam)‚Ä¶\n\\\n  10) Together, FTX & Alameda (Sam & Sam) developed a few shitcoins‚Ä¶err \"tokens\": the most relevant are $FTT and $SRM.\n\\\n  Both FTX & Alameda received huge grants of $FTT and $SRM (I'm just going to use $FTT going forward).\n\\\n  F&A (Sam) controlled the VAST majority of the issuance‚Ä¶\n\\\n  11)‚Ä¶and only a tiny portion of $FTT / $SRM traded. Alameda was the largest trader. If you own 95% of something and then manipulate the price of the other 5%, you can make your 95% look REALLY valuable - just keep the price of that 5% up and look how valuable your 95% becomes!\nhttps://tenor.com/va2h.gif?embedable=true\nGuess what Alameda (Sam) used as collateral for those margin loans we were talking about? $FTT and $SRM.\n\\\n  And it doesn't appear that FTX required a big haircut on those. Remember that Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of $TSLA stock he posts? That's an 80% haircut. But‚Ä¶\n\\\n  13)‚Ä¶it doesn't appear FTX required a substantial haircut on the $FTT that Alameda (Sam) posted. Ultimately, using these shitcoins‚Ä¶I mean tokens, as collateral, Alameda (Sam) \"borrowed\" $9-$10 billion from FTX.
