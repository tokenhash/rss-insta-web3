I’ve gone as far as <a href=\"https://github.com/dataalways/energy-adjusted-cbeci\">open-sourcing</a> analysis that demonstrates that the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index is, and will continue to be, an overestimate.

For my part, I attempt to minimize misinformation by focusing more heavily on data than narrative, however the two can never be fully separated. Responsive commentary, this writing for example, will naturally slant less data-oriented than I prefer my work to be. I do not like to write this way.</p>\n<p>Security and decentralization are particular optimizations for a blockchain, and in my opinion the most important and the most interesting.

Rather than provide a dependable voice in the debate around the future of Bitcoin’s security model or discuss the intricacies of the actual dynamics behind network security, Booth explains bitcoin mining as if he were trying to placate a toddler that asked how digital money is made. He quotes terra [sic] hash numbers knowing that no reader, nor the author, has a true understanding of what 185 million terahashes per second means in practice. Hash rate metrics are a distraction and a deception: a measure designed to increase perpetually and give the appearance of heightening security.</p>\n<p>The security of the bitcoin network is not measured in hash rate!</p>\n<p>There are two metrics that determine how protected the network is: the amount of electricity consumed by miners and the number of modern ASICs required to gain a majority of network hash rate. Hash rate statistics are simplistic approximations to these metrics; they do not account for the increasing efficiency of ASICs or varying energy costs. Hash rate is only a valid proxy if you are defending against an adversary with static technology.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Looking at the electricity spend that can be supported by the current mining dynamic, we see a healthy climb, followed by some recent stagnation. Despite the rolling-annual value being about to fall significantly below the rolling-cycle average for the first time ever, there is nothing to panic over yet. Levels remain sufficiently healthy, although we will continue to see the capitulation of mining companies unless price rebounds in the near-term. This is fine.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5FXudOwHtA0oMtJzrPf4D.webp?height=752&width=1272\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>However, concern is warranted when we break mining revenue into its corresponding parts. The stagnation in blockspace demand is very heavy, and the extreme volatility within cycles calls into question the stability of the mechanism as the block subsidy continues to be reduced.</p>\n<p>At current levels, transactions could support a single terawatt hour of mining per year. The cycle peak for usage was approximately 140 terawatt hours per year, so to simply grow demand to a point that could support the current crop of miners would be an incredible feat.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YBAmnGB1tPN1s3-qyCa-s.png?height=2600&width=4400\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Not unlike absolute hash rate statistics, electricity metrics are sufficiently abstract to be confusing, so although it is a less accurate proxy, that in a rising energy cost environment will make the network look more sustainable than it actually is, if we denominate fees in dollars, total Bitcoin transaction fees in 2022 will be their lowest full-year value since 2016.</p>\n<p>The regression in demand for blockspace, despite massive mainstream growth, seriously calls into question the long-term stability of the security model. Without rising transaction fees, to maintain the level of support for miners in the face of block subsidy cuts, the price of bitcoin is required to rise by 19% per year denominated in energy.</p>\n<p>This is not indicative of unquestionable security. It is too early to propose changes to the security model, but assuming its indefinite security is irresponsible.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Jeff Booth’s understanding of the rollover of mining devices is naïve and disconnected from how the dynamic plays out in practice. Booth claims that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the process of paying for additional equipment which is then obsoleted over time as new equipment becomes superior, is costly. This has the effect of supporting new entrants/ideas in the market. In other words, its very nature reduces the monopolistic tendencies of a market to consolidate around a few large miners and price others out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In practice, the inverse is actually true. The constant need to replace old machines with newer machines heavily favors large centralized mining operations. Large industrial miners have more negotiating power with suppliers, earn higher profits due to economies of scale and preferential power purchase agreements, and as businesses better manage their fleets of mining devices. As their machines age, many large miners dump their older generation equipment onto the market, bought up by smaller operations and home miners (lacking purchase negotiating power this is often their best choice), who then struggle to break even on their investments.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The economies of scale described above are centralizing forces that lead to the most likely short-term path of capture for Bitcoin. Hash rate controlled by publicly traded miners has grown extremely aggressively over the past three years—both by going public and through expanding their operations, and with their ease of access to cheap money, relative to private and retail miners, this trend is set to continue. These businesses expose the Bitcoin Network to risks of regulatory capture, as their primary requirement is to abide by US laws. When a Bitcoin unfriendly administration decides to take action, if public hash rate continues to trend up and breaches 51%, the administration will be able to attempt to force miners to build only KYC blocks, and only on-top of KYC blocks. This effective cartel of miners will form the longest, and therefore, according to Booth, the most trusted, chain.</p>\n<p>Booth fearmongers about the introduction of oracles, but this regulatory capture dynamic is a stark contrast to similar threats in a proof-of-stake system. Staking services tend to only be a fraction of the business of centralized custodians and therefore these custodians are able to cut off a limb and continue to operate; Coinbase for example has committed to shutting down and exiting their Ethereum validator business if forced to comply with censoring regulations (even if withdrawals are not yet enabled).</p>\n<p>Bitcoin miners have no second business income to fall back on, therefore their choices would be either full liquidation at firesale prices (while facing lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duty) or censorship.</p>\n<p>This is a terrifying timeline that is becoming more likely every day.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Booth speaks with an air of confidence on security, suggesting that the Chinese Bitcoin mining ban proved the network’s resilience to “nation-state attack[s]”, but this is twisting reality. China did not attack the Bitcoin Network, they attacked their own Bitcoin miners. An attack on the network would have been a nationalization of hash rate, but it should be clear from the past year that China’s goals were to oppress their own population and to lighten the load on their energy infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The current security of the Bitcoin Network is nowhere near sufficient to repel an attack from a motivated large economy. The US Military budget is approximately $800 billion per year, or approximately 100x the annual electricity spend of the network. Allocating only a couple percent of their operational military budget, the United States could easily cripple the system. Bitcoin is a fly on the wall, currently not worth the energy to swat it in comparison.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"scaling\">Scaling</h3>\n<p>Booth presents the following chart as showing “lightning adoption since inception”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6UWWeJ0G5iGEcfDj59S_Y.png?height=514&width=830\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I believe that Jeff Booth is a good actor, so I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt, but capacity and usage are very different metrics.</p>\n<p>There is a narrative in which these two metrics correlate: increasing usage of the Lightning Network drives fees higher, making it more <a href=\"https://voltage.cloud/blog/bitcoin-lightning-network/are-lightning-nodes-profitable/\">profitable to run Lightning nodes</a>, thus spurring higher capacity, but this narrative is only the dominant factor in a vacuum.

Upgrade now to get immediate access.\nAccess the Token Bible\n\n\nDear Bankless nation,\nSBF is in handcuffs and the holidays are just around the corner. Despite the good tidings, it’s been a rough quarter for the crypto industry — and most of our bags.\nThis week, we take a look at DeFi metrics that have been up-only since the FTX implosion. Follow along as we extrapolate what these trends could mean for crypto and your future strategies.\n- Bankless team\n\n\n5 DeFi Metrics Surging After FTX\n\nBankless Writer: Jack Inabinet, Bankless Intern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphic by Logan Craig\nWhere is capital flowing in a post-FTX world? Curious about which projects have benefited from the FTX collapse? Searching for the light in the depths of crypto doom and gloom?\nThen you’ve come to the right place! \n⬇️ Today, we’ll unpack the answers to your questions, anon: just read on ⬇️\n\n\nCEX Outflows\nRule #1: NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR CRYPTO!\nIt's amazing how many people finally grasp the value of this core crypto tenet after a major catastrophe occurs. Too bad there is not readily available data on Ledger Nano sales because it’s certainly up only as well!\nExchanges have seen a net outflow of $4.675B in stablecoins since November 4, an 11.4% decrease in exchange stablecoin balances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Nansen\nAdditionally, net Ether outflows from exchanges over the same period totaled $5.125B, representing 13.1% of total ETH previously held on CEXs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Nansen\nSince November 4, $9.8B in stables and Ether has been withdrawn from CEXs. \nWith widespread Binance insolvency fears circulating CT, it is unlikely this trend of withdrawals will reverse anytime soon.\nToday’s most sophisticated auditing solutions do little to reassure users of the safety of their assets on CEXs: \n\nProof of Reserves audits only capture assets at a moment in time\n\nUsers are unaware of liabilities and balances are not updated live\n\n\nThe quality of crypto exchange auditors has come into question\n\nComplex crypto operations seem to turn to small firms that potentially lack the resources to conduct thorough audits of the firm\n\n\nReversing capital flight will require exchanges regain the trust of their customers, which is likely a difficult task at a time when crypto market participants are (rightfully) more suspicious of centralized custodians than ever.\n\n\nGMX TVL\nJust because FTX collapsed doesn’t mean that crypto’s thirst for leverage was satiated: GMX was a major beneficiary of CEX outflows from DeFi users looking to access a trustless trading experience.\n😅It offers users up to 30x leverage, considerably higher than many DeFi protocols😅\nFew established crypto projects have higher TVLs today than they did at the start of November. USD-denominated TVL for GMX is up 9.9% from November 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: DeFi Llama\nWhen denominated in ETH, GMX’s TVL is up 41.0% since November 5! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: DeFi Llama\nMayhem and cascading insolvencies following the FTX fiasco erased value throughout the crypto ecosystem. Because of this, viewing TVL in terms of ETH can provide a more accurate proxy for a given protocol’s growth in crypto market share.\nFor example, as GMX’s USD-denominated TVL fell 25.3% from November 5 to 10, while its ETH-denominated TVL rose by 12.1%!\nTemporary decreases in GMX’s USD-denominated TVL were direct results of systemic corollary factors (i.e., risks not unique to the Protocol). Increases in ETH-denominated TVL indicate a greater percentage of crypto assets made their way onto the platform during this period, increasing market share.\nCurrently, GMX TVL is up, in terms of both USD and ETH, signaling that the platform has become a preferred choice for traders looking for decentralized alternatives to centralized exchanges.\n\n\nArbitrum TVL\nGMX comprises over half of Arbitrum’s TVL. With this framing in mind, it is not shocking that Arbitrum’s TVL has been up only post-FTX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: DeFi Llama\nWhat is shocking is that Arbitrum’s TVL, exclusive of GMX, has increased 7.6% from its pre-FTX high set on November 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: DeFi Llama (Data Download)\nWhy is this shocking?\nLet’s just say Layer 2 TVL recovery has been a little less ~optimistic~ when compared to Arbirtum: L2 USD-denominated TVL is 16.6% off its November 5 high.\n\n\n\nSource: L2Beat\nHigh fee revenue from GLP has turbocharged the Arbitrum ecosystem, boosting TVL. Yields generated from the asset’s fee structure serve as the backbone for the chain’s economy.\nArbitrum developers depend on high GLP yields!\nUmami Finance, for example, is working towards launching vaults that hedge price risk for GLP, while continuing to provide users with the associated high yield.. Higher yields on GLP make this vault, and by extension the dApp, more attractive to DeFi users. Projects on Arbitrum benefit from deeper liquidity and bolstered valuations when GMX yields are attractive.\nThe significance of yield earned on GLP to the ecosystem is evident in the resilience of the Arbirtum’s TVL to post-FTX drawdowns seen by competitive L2s.\n\n\nLeveraged Farming TVL\nSentiment and Gearbox launched on October 21 and 23, respectively, and appear primed to prove that this bear market is a build market!\nBoth protocols allow users to access juiced yields on whitelisted DeFi protocols, via the aid of undercollateralized leverage (for more information on these protocols, check out The Ultimate Guide to Undercollateralized Lending in DeFi).\nThe launch of these protocols, Gearbox in particular, was a positive catalysts for the sector’s TVL, which grew from $11.4M on October 23 to $119.9M on November 5 an increase of 🌕952%🌕!\n\n\n\nSource: DeFi Llama\nUnfortunately, the collapse of FTX slammed the brakes on the rapid TVL growth displayed in the leveraged farming sector and contributed to the segment’s observed 20.3% peak-to-trough TVL drawdown. While the sector had yet to gap-up to November 6 ATHs at the time of analysis, it was within 1% on December 13, with $118.9M in TVL. \nHigh TVL seen is likely unsustainable in the leveraged farming sector over the long-term. Gearbox represents 94% of the sector’s TVL and HEAVILY subsidizes its yields!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Gearbox\nThe Protocol rewards lenders with up to 6.66% APY in GEAR rewards on select pools to incentivize deposits. \nDiluting holders via token incentives is not a viable long-term strategy. While acquiring new users is essential to protocol success, failure to retain current users decimates a protocol’s community and can jeopardize the future of the project.\nCapital has flown into the leveraged farming sector because Gearbox, in particular, is a shiny new toy with token incentives attached. Unwinding these programs may result in TVL drawdowns for the sector.\n\n\nPolygon NFTs\nDid someone say collectible?\nStarbucks did!
