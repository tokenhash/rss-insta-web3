Adidas decided to work with NFT studio Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club, NFT influencer Gmoney and the PunksComic project to <a href=\"https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/adidas-reveals-new-nft-project-with-bored-ape-yacht-club\">produce a new 3D style collectible</a> featuring the brand’s logo and garments.</p>\n<p>In December 2021, 20,000 of the collectibles were made available to purchase for those who owned NFTs from the existing projects (i.e. owned a Bored Ape, Gmoney NFT or PunksComic), while a further 10,000 were available to the public. The buzz generated by Adidas’ collaboration with some of the biggest names in the NFT space led to the entire collection selling out in a few hours, generating over $20 million revenue.</p>\n<p>Tapping into existing projects’ communities is of course a great way to find potential buyers.

The values are lower in both ETH and USD.\nCrypto crash - there is less money in the market. $2 trillion in wealth was destroyed in the cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin and Ether having lost over 50% of their value at one point.\nThe case against:\nMeta, Snap, Twitter and Reddit have all launched NFT features on their platforms. In each case, the focus is on using NFTs as the tool to create your digital identity.\nIn other “big tech” news, eBay acquired NFT marketplace KnownOrigin, sighting NFTs as part of the company’s vision to connect buyers and sellers with “the perfect, hard-to-find, or unique addition to their collection.”\nA host of NFT startups have raised funding and brought talent into the space over the last few months.\nPromisingly, many are targeting the increasing adoption of NFTs within specific niches. For example, Draup is building a fashion metaverse platform, Verse has successfully launched, targeting fine art and curated exhibitions, while Zoop unveiled its offering centred on collectables from leading social media creators.\nIn conclusion, NFTs are happening. The current market is tough, but there’s a long way to go.\nAs this article explains we’ve merely reached “the end of the beginning.”\nIf you find submirror valuable, please consider donate to wong2.eth to help cover server cost.","guid":"https://mirror.xyz/fraserbell.eth/rlLNtJwa23aErjpV6pbJ5Kxk4k8e4vpJ8mxQ9UlHeX8","isoDate":"2022-07-26T13:47:54.000Z","from":"https://submirror.xyz/fraserbell.eth","hashId":"4848a9f50467b3e50f539e0660504447"},{"title":"Ticketmaster secretly created 5 million NFTs.","link":"https://mirror.xyz/fraserbell.eth/t-U7uSfjUX1BrtWyo53ODFORr0wWQSs7lDgciVRALDg","pubDate":"Fri, 09 Sep 2022 15:43:55 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>Ticketmaster secretly created 5 million NFTs.</p>\n<p>After partnering with NFT studio Dapper Labs and their Flow blockchain, 5 million tickets sold through Ticketmaster over the last 6 months were automatically minted onto the blockchain as NFTs.</p>\n<p>Customers who purchased the tickets will soon be able to display and trade the NFT digital collectibles.</p>\n<p>What this means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>As tickets increasingly exist only digitally, NFTs will be the medium enabling them to be sold before and after events</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Before and during events: NFT is your access to the event</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>After events: NFT is your proof of attendance and digital souvenir</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep an eye on event organisers designing limited edition ticket artwork designed to increase the demand for and resale value of digital tickets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-all-for-now-stay-tuned-for-another-post-very-shortly\">That’s all for now, stay tuned for another post very shortly.</h2>\n<p><em>If you find submirror valuable, please consider donate to wong2.eth to help cover server cost.</em></p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Ticketmaster secretly created 5 million NFTs.\nAfter partnering with NFT studio Dapper Labs and their Flow blockchain, 5 million tickets sold through Ticketmaster over the last 6 months were automatically minted onto the blockchain as NFTs.\nCustomers who purchased the tickets will soon be able to display and trade the NFT digital collectibles.\nWhat this means:\nAs tickets increasingly exist only digitally, NFTs will be the medium enabling them to be sold before and after events\nBefore and during events: NFT is your access to the event\nAfter events: NFT is your proof of attendance and digital souvenir\nKeep an eye on event organisers designing limited edition ticket artwork designed to increase the demand for and resale value of digital tickets.\nThat’s all for now, stay tuned for another post very shortly.\nIf you find submirror valuable, please consider donate to wong2.eth to help cover server cost.","guid":"https://mirror.xyz/fraserbell.eth/t-U7uSfjUX1BrtWyo53ODFORr0wWQSs7lDgciVRALDg","isoDate":"2022-09-09T15:43:55.000Z","from":"https://submirror.xyz/fraserbell.eth","hashId":"488237620d8b91884b5f734e6e8ae874"},{"title":"Apple + NFTs?","link":"https://mirror.xyz/fraserbell.eth/K_hLKmlPgRjjDb3muunI5L4h1MbfS7mrElgzhvCR530","pubDate":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 11:58:55 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>While the Apple Event of September 7th may not have included any announcements relating to web3, what might Apple’s strategy for the space look like?</p>\n<p>3 thoughts:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong></p>\n<p>Integrating cryptocurrency into Apple Pay is an obvious quick win, and their willingness to explore financial services has already been proven with products like Apple Pay, Apple Card (a US-only credit card) and the related acquisition of UK open banking startup Credit Kudos.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong></p>\n<p>More than 1 billion people use Apple products - mostly through the iPhone.

It has some quirks and a learning curve, but ultimately you can ship production-ready code with it pretty fast. <br>However, sometimes you have performance-critical sections and Swift just doesn’t cut it. In such cases, a popular choice is using C++.</p><p>And the question arises “how do I call this C++ func from Swift”?</p><p>Usually, you have to write <a href=\"https://ksemianov.github.io/articles/cpp2swift/\">an Objective-C wrapper that will act as a public interface for your C++ code</a>. And Swift toolchain can import Objective-C declarations to Swift. The main limitation is that you cannot use C++ classes in Objective-C, only simple POD structs.</p><p>We’ll write a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes\">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a> algorithm with both C++ and Swift. Then learn how to enable C++ interop, call C++ code from Swift, and compare implementation performance.</p><p>Keep in mind that the feature is experimental and subject to changes. This publication compiles on Xcode Version 14.2</p><h3>Algorithm</h3><p>The Sieve of Eratosthenes finds all prime numbers less than or equal N. Prime number is an integer that’s divisible only by itself and 1. The algorithm creates a boolean array to indicate if each number is prime. And progressively iterates over them, marking all multiples as not prime.</p><p>Here is the Swift implementation.</p><pre>// primes.swift<br><br>func primes(n: Int) -&gt; [Int] {<br>    var isPrime = [Bool](repeating: true, count: n + 1)<br><br>    for value in stride(from: 2, to: n + 1, by: 1) where isPrime[value] {<br>        if value * value &gt; n { break }<br><br>        for multiple in stride(from: value * 2, to: n + 1, by: value) {<br>            isPrime[multiple] = false<br>        }<br>    }<br><br>    var result = [Int]()<br><br>    for value in stride(from: 2, to: n + 1, by: 1) where isPrime[value] {<br>        result.append(value)<br>    }<br><br>    return result<br>}</pre><p>For C++ we need a header and a source file.

It has some quirks and a learning curve, but ultimately you can ship production-ready code with it pretty fast. \nHowever, sometimes you have performance-critical sections and Swift just doesn’t cut it. In such cases, a popular choice is using C++.\nAnd the question arises “how do I call this C++ func from Swift”?\nUsually, you have to write an Objective-C wrapper that will act as a public interface for your C++ code. And Swift toolchain can import Objective-C declarations to Swift. The main limitation is that you cannot use C++ classes in Objective-C, only simple POD structs.\nWe’ll write a Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm with both C++ and Swift. Then learn how to enable C++ interop, call C++ code from Swift, and compare implementation performance.\nKeep in mind that the feature is experimental and subject to changes. This publication compiles on Xcode Version 14.2\nAlgorithm\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes finds all prime numbers less than or equal N. Prime number is an integer that’s divisible only by itself and 1. The algorithm creates a boolean array to indicate if each number is prime. And progressively iterates over them, marking all multiples as not prime.\nHere is the Swift implementation.\n// primes.swift\nfunc primes(n: Int) -> [Int] {\n    var isPrime = [Bool](repeating: true, count: n + 1)\n    for value in stride(from: 2, to: n + 1, by: 1) where isPrime[value] {\n        if value * value > n { break }\n        for multiple in stride(from: value * 2, to: n + 1, by: value) {\n            isPrime[multiple] = false\n        }\n    }\n    var result = [Int]()\n    for value in stride(from: 2, to: n + 1, by: 1) where isPrime[value] {\n        result.append(value)\n    }\n    return result\n}\nFor C++ we need a header and a source file. Note, that we typedef to have a cleaner name for referring to std::vector<long>.\n// primes.hpp\n#include <vector>\ntypedef std::vector<long> VectorLong;\nVectorLong primes(const long &n);\n// primes.cpp\n#include <algorithm>\n#include \"primes.hpp\"\nVectorLong primes(const long &n) {\n    std::vector<char> isPrime(n + 1); // faster than std::vector<bool>\n    std::fill(isPrime.begin(), isPrime.end(), true);\n    for (long value = 2; value * value <= n; ++value) {\n        if (!isPrime[value]) { continue; }\n        for (long multiple = value * 2; multiple <= n; multiple += value) {\n            isPrime[multiple] = false;\n        }\n    }\n    VectorLong result;\n    for (long value = 2; value <= n; ++value) {\n        if (!isPrime[value]) { continue; }\n        result.push_back(value);\n    }\n    return result;\n}\nProject structure\nWe’ll do a Swift Package with two separate targets to hold our Swift and C++ code. To import C++ code from Swift, we need a modulemap.\n// module.modulemap\nmodule CXX {\n    header \"CXX.hpp\"\n    requires cplusplus\n}\n// CXX.hpp\n#include \"primes.hpp\"\nAnd do not forget to pass -enable-experimental-cxx-interop to the Swift target in Package.swift.\n// swift-tools-version: 5.7\nimport PackageDescription\nlet package = Package(\n    name: \"SwiftCXXInteropExample\",\n    platforms: [\n        .macOS(.v12),\n    ],\n    products: [\n        .library(name: \"CXX\", targets: [\"CXX\"]),\n        .executable(name: \"CLI\", targets: [\"CLI\"])\n    ],\n    dependencies: [],\n    targets: [\n        .target(name: \"CXX\"),\n        .executableTarget(\n            name: \"CLI\",\n            dependencies: [\"CXX\"],\n            swiftSettings: [.unsafeFlags([\"-enable-experimental-cxx-interop\"])]\n        )\n    ]\n)\nSee the doc from Apple for more info on how to enable C++ interop.\nTrying out\nIt’s much easier to use our VectorLong from Swift with conformance to RandomAccessCollection and, happily, it's really easy to do.\nimport CXX\nextension VectorLong: RandomAccessCollection {\n    public var startIndex: Int { 0 }\n    public var endIndex: Int { size() }\n}\nNow we can call our C++ function from Swift and print the results to the console.\nlet cxxVector = primes(100)\nlet swiftArray = [Int](cxxVector)\nprint(swiftArray)\nLet’s see if our C++ implementation actually performs faster.\nlet signposter = OSSignposter()\nlet count = 100\nlet n = 10_000_000\nfor _ in 0..<count {\n    let state = signposter.beginInterval(\"C++\")\n    let _ = primes(n)\n    signposter.endInterval(\"C++\", state)\n}\nfor _ in 0..<count {\n    let state = signposter.beginInterval(\"Swift\")\n    let _ = primes(n: n)\n    signposter.endInterval(\"Swift\", state)\n}\nSlightly faster with an average duration of 26 ms vs. 28 ms for Swift.\nFinal Thoughts\nWe were able to directly use std::vector in Swift.
