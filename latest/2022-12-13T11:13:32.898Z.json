Data Pipeline is a customized data source, or “connector,” built on <a href=\"https://airbyte.com/\">Airbyte</a>, which provides an ELT approach allowing users to select which KYVE data set to extract, load it onto their preferred backend, then transform it in whatever or however many ways they need for their use case.

For those wanting to code their own solution for sourcing KYVE data, they can do so via the REST-API.</p><h3>Data Access Via REST-API</h3><p>The REST-API is a resource model outlining the major details you need to know about a given piece of data. For example, where and how it’s being stored. For KYVE, its data is available through the REST-API exposed by its chain nodes. This integration is a native way to access data in a completely trustless way via coding your own solution to get KYVE data (currently on testnet) onto your own application and or database. To get started, a list of REST endpoints can be found<a href=\"https://docs.kyve.network/developers/grpc.html#api-endpoint\"> here</a>.</p><p>Since KYVE stores data onto specialized providers and not natively on its own chain, developers must fetch the underlying data directly from the storage provider. The KYVE REST-API holds the proof that data on a storage provider is valid and can be retrieved trustless. A list of valid bundles is available at the kyve/query/v1beta1/finalized_bundles/[pool_id] path.</p><p>From this, the developer will get the storage_provider_id which points to a storage provider. In combination with the storage_id, developers can retrieve the uploaded data.</p><p>Some integrations might compress data before storing it on the storage provider. The compression_id indicates which compression method has been used.</p><p>Below displays the general workflow of this process:</p><pre>response = <br>requests.get(f”https://api.korellia.kyve.network/kyve/query/v1beta1/finalized_bundles/{pool_id_input}&quot;)<br>for bundle in response.json().get(“finalized_bundles”):<br>   storage_id = bundle.get(“storage_id”)<br><br>   # retrieve file from Arweave<br>   response_from_arweave = <br>requests.get(f”https://arweave.net/{storage_id}&quot;)<br>   decompressed = gzip.decompress(response_from_arweave.content)<br>   decompressed_as_json = json.loads(decompressed)</pre><p>After the data has been retrieved from the storage provider and decompressed, developers can use it in their applications.</p><h3>More Solutions to Come</h3><p>KYVE’s goal is to help build a secure, scalable, and trustless data infrastructure for all; therefore, our team is always looking for new ways to ease the data use and access experience. With new data risks and KYVE use cases popping up each day, KYVE is just getting started introducing new solutions to best benefit from its decentralized data lake.
