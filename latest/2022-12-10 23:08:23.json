The company’s hashrate capacity continues to be 2.5 EH/s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Core Scientific, which had not yet published its November production update as of Friday morning, has roughly self-mined between 45 BTC and 50 BTC each day this week, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Core_Scientific/status/1601230408837996545\">tweets</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core Scientific did not return a request for further comment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iris Energy, which also previously expressed its <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/bitcoin-miner-iris-energy-says-its-bad-debt-contained-in-rotten-arms\">financial distress</a>, is also seeking to stay afloat and eyes expansion.
