While symbolic execution is a powerful technique that can augment the vulnerability discovery process, it requires some base domain knowledge and thus has its own learning curve. Given the plethora of ways in which a user can interact with such an engine and the need for frequent context switching between a disassembler and one’s terminal or script editor, integrating symbolic execution into one’s workflow can be daunting for a beginner.</p>\n<p>One of the ways Trail of Bits has sought to ease this process is by making graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Manticore that are embedded in popular interactive disassemblers. Last summer, former intern Alan Chang worked on the first such interface, <a href=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/11/17/mui-visualizing-symbolic-execution-with-manticore-and-binary-ninja/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Manticore User Interface (MUI) plugin for Binary Ninja</a>. We found that pairing Manticore directly with an interactive disassembler provides vulnerability researchers with a more convenient way to actually use (and benefit from) symbolic execution. Therefore, during my winter and summer internships at Trail of Bits, my goal was to help grow the MUI ecosystem by making a MUI plugin for Ghidra and building infrastructure to make these plugins easier to use, maintain, and develop.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103448\" style=\"width: 791px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103448\" data-attachment-id=\"103448\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/manitcore_chart/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=781%2C321&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"781,321\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Manitcore_chart\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=690%2C284&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-103448\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=690%2C284&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?w=781&amp;ssl=1 781w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=768%2C316&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103448\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.</p></div>\n<h2>The Ghidra Plugin</h2>\n<p>We figured that the most direct way to encourage more people to use MUI plugins would be to simply develop MUI plugins for a greater variety of disassemblers! Thus, I spent my winternship developing a Ghidra version of the MUI plugin; I chose Ghidra chiefly because it is popular and, unlike the commercial tool Binary Ninja, free and open source. Additionally, a few internal projects at Trail of Bits were already using Ghidra, so I would have ample opportunity to explore Ghidra plugin development. Finally, by developing a Ghidra plugin (one written in Java instead of Python), we could develop a solution that wouldn’t be tied to a single programming language, gaining insight that could guide the development of future plugins.</p>\n<p>This initial Ghidra plugin mimicked the existing Binary Ninja plugin as closely as possible. While it took a bit of time to become familiar with Java Swing and Ghidra’s widgets, simply mimicking the existing visual components and user interface was a fairly trivial task once I got going.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103450\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103450\" data-attachment-id=\"103450\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4-06-25-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=1240%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1240,416\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 4.06.25 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;A side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=300%2C101&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=690%2C232&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=690%2C232&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=1024%2C344&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=300%2C101&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=768%2C258&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=1200%2C403&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?w=1240&amp;ssl=1 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.</p></div>\n<p>However, because the Ghidra plugin would be written in Java, it could not depend on the Manticore Python package or directly call Manticore’s Python API. Our solution to that challenge was to use a tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/linkedin/shiv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shiv</a> to seamlessly bundle the Manticore library and all of its dependencies into a <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0441/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python zipapp</a>. That way, we could create a “batteries-included” Manticore binary and then translate the Binary Ninja plugin’s interactions with the Manticore API into the appropriate command-line arguments. We then placed this binary in the relevant platform-specific subdirectories of Ghidra’s <code>os</code> directory, which facilitates cross-platform support.</p>\n<p>By the end of the winternship, I was able to add extra features to the Ghidra plugin, such as the ability to specify arbitrary Manticore arguments in addition to those with dedicated input fields and support for multiple Manticore instances in the same Ghidra session. This, however, brought to light an additional problem.</p>\n<h2>Feature parity and cross-disassembler development</h2>\n<p>It quickly became apparent that our approach to plugin development would not be sustainable if we aspired to expand the MUI project to support even more disassemblers. For each new MUI feature, we would first have to determine how to implement the feature, accounting for the way that the plugin interacts with Manticore (e.g., through direct calls to the Manticore API or through Manticore’s command-line interface options). Furthermore, certain front-end information shared across plugins (e.g., fixed description strings or sensible default options) would have to be repeated and standardized in each implementation.</p>\n<p>To address this problem, over the summer I developed a centralized remote procedure call (RPC) server binary for MUI. This server handles all interactions with the full-featured Manticore Python API and handles MUI functionality through individual RPCs defined in a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protocol buffer</a>. We chose to use <a href=\"https://grpc.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gRPC</a> as our RPC framework because of its performance, wide adoption, and strong support for code generation across many programming languages. As a result, MUI plugins of the future can easily contain and depend on their own gRPC-generated code.</p>\n<p>The server is written in Python, providing it access to the full functionality of Manticore’s Python API, but is bundled into a shiv binary that can be called in any language. This facilitates a new client-server architecture that allows developers to implement any back-end Manticore functionality and tests just once. Developers of the front-end disassembler plugins can make RPC requests to the server with just a few lines of trivial code, which means that their work on individual plugins can focus almost entirely on front-end/UI changes.</p>\n<p>To alleviate the “chore” of handling fixed strings and other front-end information that will be identical across plugins, we can store such data in JSON files that are packaged with MUI plugin releases and loaded on startup. In this way, we can standardize data such as the fields, field descriptors, and default values of the run dialogs used to start Manticore’s execution.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103454\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103454\" data-attachment-id=\"103454\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/fixed_data/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=1600%2C1159&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1159\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fixed_data\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Fixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=690%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103454\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=690%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1024%2C742&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=768%2C556&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1536%2C1113&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1200%2C869&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.</p></div>\n<h2>Demo: Developing a Feature for MUI</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the process of developing a feature for MUI. Suppose that we want to enable manual state management during the runtime of a Manticore instance. Specifically, we want the ability to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pause</strong> a state and <strong>resume</strong> it at a later time, which will be useful if we implement capabilities like execution tracing in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Kill</strong> a state at our discretion. That way, if a state bypasses an <code>avoid</code> hook or becomes stuck in an infinite loop, we will be able to abandon it.First, we will define a new RPC and the RPC’s message formats in our protocol buffer file. The server will receive the state’s numeric ID, the Manticore instance that we’re working with, and a <code>StateAction</code> enum indicating whether it should resume, pause, or kill the state.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_103456\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103456\" data-attachment-id=\"103456\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/rpc_details/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=1534%2C1124&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1534,1124\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"RPC_details\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Details of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=690%2C505&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103456\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=690%2C505&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=1024%2C750&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=768%2C563&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=1200%2C879&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?w=1534&amp;ssl=1 1534w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103456\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Details of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.</p></div>\n<p>We’ll also need to update an existing message—<code>ManticoreStateList</code>.

In our plugins, we encapsulate all such “connector” functions in a single file. In the Ghidra plugin, writing a connector function involves only three steps. First, we create a <code>StreamObserver</code> object to asynchronously handle RPC responses. In this case, we need only implement behavior for handling error cases, since the “results” of successful <code>ControlState</code> RPCs will be available to the user via the <code>GetStateList</code> RPC. Then we build the <code>ControlStateRequest</code> object, populating the fields as required. Lastly, we actually execute the RPC through a method exposed by the gRPC-generated <code>ManticoreServerStub</code>, which conveniently handles all communication with the server for us.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103468\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103468\" data-attachment-id=\"103468\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/connector_method/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=1600%2C1474&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1474\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"connector_method\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=690%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103468\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=690%2C635&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"635\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1024%2C943&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=768%2C708&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1536%2C1415&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1200%2C1106&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103468\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.</p></div>\n<p>The only thing left to do is to make the appropriate UI changes!

While symbolic execution is a powerful technique that can augment the vulnerability discovery process, it requires some base domain knowledge and thus has its own learning curve. Given the plethora of ways in which a user can interact with such an engine and the need for frequent context switching between a disassembler and one’s terminal or script editor, integrating symbolic execution into one’s workflow can be daunting for a beginner.\nOne of the ways Trail of Bits has sought to ease this process is by making graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Manticore that are embedded in popular interactive disassemblers. Last summer, former intern Alan Chang worked on the first such interface, the Manticore User Interface (MUI) plugin for Binary Ninja. We found that pairing Manticore directly with an interactive disassembler provides vulnerability researchers with a more convenient way to actually use (and benefit from) symbolic execution. Therefore, during my winter and summer internships at Trail of Bits, my goal was to help grow the MUI ecosystem by making a MUI plugin for Ghidra and building infrastructure to make these plugins easier to use, maintain, and develop.\n\nThe gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.\n\nThe Ghidra Plugin\nWe figured that the most direct way to encourage more people to use MUI plugins would be to simply develop MUI plugins for a greater variety of disassemblers! Thus, I spent my winternship developing a Ghidra version of the MUI plugin; I chose Ghidra chiefly because it is popular and, unlike the commercial tool Binary Ninja, free and open source. Additionally, a few internal projects at Trail of Bits were already using Ghidra, so I would have ample opportunity to explore Ghidra plugin development. Finally, by developing a Ghidra plugin (one written in Java instead of Python), we could develop a solution that wouldn’t be tied to a single programming language, gaining insight that could guide the development of future plugins.\nThis initial Ghidra plugin mimicked the existing Binary Ninja plugin as closely as possible. While it took a bit of time to become familiar with Java Swing and Ghidra’s widgets, simply mimicking the existing visual components and user interface was a fairly trivial task once I got going.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.\n\nHowever, because the Ghidra plugin would be written in Java, it could not depend on the Manticore Python package or directly call Manticore’s Python API. Our solution to that challenge was to use a tool called shiv to seamlessly bundle the Manticore library and all of its dependencies into a Python zipapp. That way, we could create a “batteries-included” Manticore binary and then translate the Binary Ninja plugin’s interactions with the Manticore API into the appropriate command-line arguments. We then placed this binary in the relevant platform-specific subdirectories of Ghidra’s os directory, which facilitates cross-platform support.\nBy the end of the winternship, I was able to add extra features to the Ghidra plugin, such as the ability to specify arbitrary Manticore arguments in addition to those with dedicated input fields and support for multiple Manticore instances in the same Ghidra session. This, however, brought to light an additional problem.\nFeature parity and cross-disassembler development\nIt quickly became apparent that our approach to plugin development would not be sustainable if we aspired to expand the MUI project to support even more disassemblers. For each new MUI feature, we would first have to determine how to implement the feature, accounting for the way that the plugin interacts with Manticore (e.g., through direct calls to the Manticore API or through Manticore’s command-line interface options). Furthermore, certain front-end information shared across plugins (e.g., fixed description strings or sensible default options) would have to be repeated and standardized in each implementation.\nTo address this problem, over the summer I developed a centralized remote procedure call (RPC) server binary for MUI. This server handles all interactions with the full-featured Manticore Python API and handles MUI functionality through individual RPCs defined in a protocol buffer. We chose to use gRPC as our RPC framework because of its performance, wide adoption, and strong support for code generation across many programming languages. As a result, MUI plugins of the future can easily contain and depend on their own gRPC-generated code.\nThe server is written in Python, providing it access to the full functionality of Manticore’s Python API, but is bundled into a shiv binary that can be called in any language. This facilitates a new client-server architecture that allows developers to implement any back-end Manticore functionality and tests just once. Developers of the front-end disassembler plugins can make RPC requests to the server with just a few lines of trivial code, which means that their work on individual plugins can focus almost entirely on front-end/UI changes.\nTo alleviate the “chore” of handling fixed strings and other front-end information that will be identical across plugins, we can store such data in JSON files that are packaged with MUI plugin releases and loaded on startup. In this way, we can standardize data such as the fields, field descriptors, and default values of the run dialogs used to start Manticore’s execution.\n\nFixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.\n\nDemo: Developing a Feature for MUI\nLet’s take a look at the process of developing a feature for MUI. Suppose that we want to enable manual state management during the runtime of a Manticore instance. Specifically, we want the ability to do the following:\nPause a state and resume it at a later time, which will be useful if we implement capabilities like execution tracing in the future.\nKill a state at our discretion. That way, if a state bypasses an avoid hook or becomes stuck in an infinite loop, we will be able to abandon it.First, we will define a new RPC and the RPC’s message formats in our protocol buffer file. The server will receive the state’s numeric ID, the Manticore instance that we’re working with, and a StateAction enum indicating whether it should resume, pause, or kill the state.\n\nDetails of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.\n\nWe’ll also need to update an existing message—ManticoreStateList. MUI plugins have state lists that display all states and the status of each state; these lists are updated via a GetStateList RPC. Because it’d be beneficial for users to see “paused” states as distinct from preexisting state statuses, we’ll add a new paused_states field to the RPC’s response message, which will contain a list of the states paused by the user.\n\nThe existing ManticoreStateList message is updated with a new paused_states attribute.\n\nWith that, we can proceed to generate the Python service interface code and mypy type stubs! During my summer internship, I used the command runner just to abstract away this work for developers, so we can run the just generate command to…just generate the required code!\nNow we can move on to implementing the back-end functionality. This code is contained in a single Servicer class in which each method represents an individual RPC.\nWe’ll begin by validating the RPC request data. While gRPC-generated code can check that the fields provided to it are correctly typed, it cannot enforce the use of any fields or verify that fields are well formed. Thus, we’ll write our own checks to assert the validity of the request; we’ll also set an error code and error details to be returned to the requester if the request is invalid.\n\nCode added to the back-end server validates the incoming RPC request.\n\nFinally, we can implement the state-pausing and state-killing functionality by directly accessing Manticore’s Python API. This direct access provides us far more control than we’d have if we were interacting with Manticore through its command-line options, enabling us to create a dummy busy state or abandon a specific state, for example. If all goes well, the front-end plugin will receive an empty response, which will be populated with the default OK status code.\n\nOnce the state has been successfully processed, an empty response object is returned.\n\nOne additional benefit of our approach is that we can write tests for our RPCs without having to deal with spawning up a server and connecting to it. Instead, we can simply call the Servicer’s methods directly and pass in a new Context object, which we can later inspect for error codes.\n\nWriting tests is as simple as directly calling the Servicer’s methods.\n\nOnce we’re done, we can use our trusty command runner to “just build” the shiv binary, which will give us a fresh server binary that we can use in our plugins.\nFirst, we need to generate the Java service interface code, which will be based on the updated protocol buffer. gRPC maintains a Java library, grpc-java, that will handle this for us.\nThen, we have to write the function that actually executes the RPC. In our plugins, we encapsulate all such “connector” functions in a single file. In the Ghidra plugin, writing a connector function involves only three steps. First, we create a StreamObserver object to asynchronously handle RPC responses. In this case, we need only implement behavior for handling error cases, since the “results” of successful ControlState RPCs will be available to the user via the GetStateList RPC. Then we build the ControlStateRequest object, populating the fields as required. Lastly, we actually execute the RPC through a method exposed by the gRPC-generated ManticoreServerStub, which conveniently handles all communication with the server for us.\n\nThe new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.\n\nThe only thing left to do is to make the appropriate UI changes! For this feature, we can simply open a context menu by right-clicking on a state in the state list and then populate the state with the actions that call the controlState method!\n\nThe added code creates a new option in the context menu and calls the “connector” method when that new option is selected.\n\n\nWith the Manticore functionality handled by the gRPC server, the UI changes that we must implement on the “front ends” of the Ghidra and Binary Ninja plugins are fairly straightforward.\n\nThe “hypothetical” state management feature discussed in the demo has actually been implemented and is now part of MUI!

These \"one-hop\" addresses are typically controlled by individual miners contributing hash power to their mining pool of choice. Active miner addresses tend to peak just after Bitcoin price has topped, with slow-moving hardware deployments arriving late to the party as speculative enthusiasm begins to dwindle. Five months after the BTC price peaked in December 2017, monthly active miner addresses tipped 80,000, only to crash to lows near 10,000 in 2020.</p><p>This bull cycle, we didn't see nearly the same level of mining mania reflected in active addresses, potentially due to the consolidation of hash power into a smaller set of publicly-traded entities. However, in 2022 we've still seen the number of active mining addresses fall more than 50% from recent highs, reaching the lowest levels since 2011. Miner active addresses appeared to find a bottom in August, bouncing weakly back over the past few months, but activity could easily decline in December as major miners continue to file for bankruptcy.</p><p>Though the mining industry has matured significantly in the past few years, the continued trend of cyclical capitulation indicates the sector has some progress to make on proper risk management. While power-purchasing agreements enable miners to control exposure to rising energy prices, options for managing exposure to hashprice&#8212; a metric measuring USD-denominated revenue per unit of hashrate&#8212; are slim to none. To this end, mining service providers like Luxor Technologies have developed derivatives products for more sophisticated operations, allowing miners to hedge their exposure by selling hashprice <a href=\"https://hashrateindex.com/blog/luxor-technologies-launches-otc-bitcoin-mining-derivative/\">Non-Deliverable Forward</a> (NDF) contracts.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"704\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em><a href=\"https://luxor.tech/derivatives\">Source: Luxor Technologies</a></em></p><p>In the example scenario pictured above, a miner could use Luxor's NDF contract to hedge against a month-over-month decline in hashprice. Normally, a drop in hashprice would simply result in a loss of revenue&#8212; however, if a miner sold 1,500 NDF contracts at $90 per PH/s/day, they'd effectively lock-in revenue at this threshold. Thirty days later, the miner settles the contract at a hashprice of $70 per PH/s/day, netting a $30K profit and offsetting a broader decline in mining revenue.</p><p>While Luxor's hashprice marketplace is still in its early stages, hashrate derivatives will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in managing miner risk, especially as the industry continues to attract capital allocators from more traditional sectors.</p><h3>Foundry Hammers the Competition</h3><p>With the collapse of Poolin and the unprecedented growth of the U.S. mining industry, Foundry USA Pool has aggressively expanded its share of the Bitcoin hashrate. While <a href=\"https://coinmetrics.substack.com/i/75132155/poolin-goes-off-the-deep-end\">the Poolin episode</a> serves as a healthy reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the mining pool ecosystem, the migration of hashrate has furthered the dominance of the top 3 mining pools, with Foundry, AntPool, and F2Pool collectively controlling well over 50% of market share. Foundry&#8217;s place in the top 3 is especially noteworthy, with the American mining pool overtaking the longstanding leadership of Asia-based pools at the beginning of 2022.</p><div

href=\"https://coinmetrics.io/atlas/\">Source: Coin Metrics ATLAS</a></em></p><p>Foundry&#8217;s lack of empty blocks serves as a testament to the pool&#8217;s block templating prowess. In the split seconds after a block is mined, mining pools scramble to assemble a new block template, selecting the highest-paying transactions for inclusion in their next attempt at solving the Proof-of-Work. During this short period, pools continue to throw off hashrate, meaning there&#8217;s a small chance of a block being mined before a transaction-bearing template is fully assembled.</p><p>So far in 2022, Foundry has constructed block templates quickly enough to beat the clock. With the <a href=\"https://braiins.com/stratum-v2\">upcoming release</a> of Stratum V2, however, individual miners will soon have the option of assembling their own templates, cutting mining pool-middlemen out of the transaction selection process. Whether this will affect the frequency of empty blocks&#8212; and how that will impact the mining pool landscape&#8212; still remains to be seen.</p><h3>Waves in the Mempool</h3><p>Through the latter half of 2022, the mempool has remained relatively muted, with the exception of a prolonged period of congestion in mid-November.

To catch up on our other quarterly mining reviews from this year, check out the links below.\nSOTN’s 2022 Quarterly Mining Specials: Q1, Q2, Q3 \nBitcoin hash rate continued to push higher throughout most of Q4 in spite of a subdued spot BTC price. Hash rate — a proxy for the total amount of computational effort securing the network — hit as high as 250 EH/s (quintillion hashes per second) in late October, an all-time high. Hash rate had grown throughout the summer as publicly-traded Bitcoin miners continued to add capacity via mining rigs pre-ordered during the bull market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics Network Data Pro\nThere’s a potentially interesting explanation behind the late September and October rise in hash rate: The Ethereum Merge. As independent crypto researcher Data Always has suggested, the end of Ethereum mining likely incentivized operators to repurpose industrial rack space, swapping out GPUs used to mine Ethereum with ASICs used to mine Bitcoin. It’s hard to put an exact figure on the magnitude of this resource reallocation, but Bitcoin hash rate grew quickly from 220 EH/s to 250 EH/s shortly after the completion of The Merge in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: “The Merge and crypto's electricity consumption” by Data Always\nHowever, with the price of spot BTC facing renewed downward pressure in the wake of FTX’s failures, hash rate has started to slide. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty — a network parameter that automatically adjusts every 2 weeks to keep block times in check — decreased by more than 7% recently (see first chart above), the biggest decrease since miners abruptly exited China in spring 2021. \nThe stagnation in hash rate is a sign that miners are facing a new round of challenges amid wary market conditions.\nSigns of Miner Capitulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Coin Metrics ATLAS & Reference Rates \nOne proxy we can use to monitor mining activity is the number of Bitcoin addresses receiving payouts directly from mining pools. These \"one-hop\" addresses are typically controlled by individual miners contributing hash power to their mining pool of choice. Active miner addresses tend to peak just after Bitcoin price has topped, with slow-moving hardware deployments arriving late to the party as speculative enthusiasm begins to dwindle. Five months after the BTC price peaked in December 2017, monthly active miner addresses tipped 80,000, only to crash to lows near 10,000 in 2020.\nThis bull cycle, we didn't see nearly the same level of mining mania reflected in active addresses, potentially due to the consolidation of hash power into a smaller set of publicly-traded entities. However, in 2022 we've still seen the number of active mining addresses fall more than 50% from recent highs, reaching the lowest levels since 2011. Miner active addresses appeared to find a bottom in August, bouncing weakly back over the past few months, but activity could easily decline in December as major miners continue to file for bankruptcy.\nThough the mining industry has matured significantly in the past few years, the continued trend of cyclical capitulation indicates the sector has some progress to make on proper risk management. While power-purchasing agreements enable miners to control exposure to rising energy prices, options for managing exposure to hashprice— a metric measuring USD-denominated revenue per unit of hashrate— are slim to none. To this end, mining service providers like Luxor Technologies have developed derivatives products for more sophisticated operations, allowing miners to hedge their exposure by selling hashprice Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Luxor Technologies\nIn the example scenario pictured above, a miner could use Luxor's NDF contract to hedge against a month-over-month decline in hashprice. Normally, a drop in hashprice would simply result in a loss of revenue— however, if a miner sold 1,500 NDF contracts at $90 per PH/s/day, they'd effectively lock-in revenue at this threshold. Thirty days later, the miner settles the contract at a hashprice of $70 per PH/s/day, netting a $30K profit and offsetting a broader decline in mining revenue.\nWhile Luxor's hashprice marketplace is still in its early stages, hashrate derivatives will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in managing miner risk, especially as the industry continues to attract capital allocators from more traditional sectors.\nFoundry Hammers the Competition\nWith the collapse of Poolin and the unprecedented growth of the U.S. mining industry, Foundry USA Pool has aggressively expanded its share of the Bitcoin hashrate. While the Poolin episode serves as a healthy reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the mining pool ecosystem, the migration of hashrate has furthered the dominance of the top 3 mining pools, with Foundry, AntPool, and F2Pool collectively controlling well over 50% of market share. Foundry’s place in the top 3 is especially noteworthy, with the American mining pool overtaking the longstanding leadership of Asia-based pools at the beginning of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics ATLAS\nInterestingly, Foundry has also managed to maintain its foothold as the dominant mining pool without mining a single empty block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics ATLAS\nFoundry’s lack of empty blocks serves as a testament to the pool’s block templating prowess. In the split seconds after a block is mined, mining pools scramble to assemble a new block template, selecting the highest-paying transactions for inclusion in their next attempt at solving the Proof-of-Work. During this short period, pools continue to throw off hashrate, meaning there’s a small chance of a block being mined before a transaction-bearing template is fully assembled.\nSo far in 2022, Foundry has constructed block templates quickly enough to beat the clock. With the upcoming release of Stratum V2, however, individual miners will soon have the option of assembling their own templates, cutting mining pool-middlemen out of the transaction selection process. Whether this will affect the frequency of empty blocks— and how that will impact the mining pool landscape— still remains to be seen.\nWaves in the Mempool\nThrough the latter half of 2022, the mempool has remained relatively muted, with the exception of a prolonged period of congestion in mid-November. A massive flood of 12-15 sat/vB transactions (allegedly due to a Binance cold wallet consolidation) resulted in a substantial spike in the average mining reward, with F2Pool netting over 0.73 BTC in transaction fees for a single block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics FARUM\nOf course, it wouldn't be a Bitcoin bear market without a bit of vicious community in-fighting about seemingly minor technical details. Casual users of Bitcoin likely haven’t even heard of Replace-by-Fee (RBF), a unique transaction type that allows users the option to re-broadcast a prior on-chain payment with a slightly higher fee.\nReplace-by-Fee was designed to help relieve mempool pressure in periods of congestion, allowing users to bump transactions up the priority queue in exchange for a slightly higher tip to miners. However, members of Bitcoin’s business community warn the feature is easy to abuse— users can also “reverse” 0-confirmation transactions by re-broadcasting a payment and substituting their own address as the recipient. For merchants unsuspectingly accepting malicious 0-conf transactions, this effectively amounts to a double-spend, increasing the risk of chargeback fraud.\nSince their introduction in 2016, RBF-enabled transactions have become increasingly common. However, with the controversial release of Bitcoin Core 24.0, Replace-by-Fee is now the default setting for node mempools. While this change has seen plenty of pushback from the merchant community, developers stand firmly behind the upgrade, arguing that 0-confirmations have never been safe to accept in the first place. If you want instant settlement, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is a better option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: txstats.coinmetrics.io\nIn any case, miners have little direct incentive to worry about the potential for Replace-by-Fee fraud. Higher fees simply boost miner’s bottom line, no matter where they come from. Nonetheless, the increased complexity of monitoring RBF transactions could also make block templating significantly more difficult, forcing miners to keep their finger on the pulse of the mempool more than ever before.\nBetter Hashing Days Ahead?\nMiners have had a tough year and a particularly hard Q4. Looking to 2023, there are plenty of outstanding questions that will dictate the direction of the Bitcoin mining industry beyond just the price of BTC. \nWith the expansion of the industry’s US footprint, mining is being analyzed differently by various jurisdictions. In November, New York enacted a first of its kind two-year moratorium on new mining operations in the state. Meanwhile, as Texas prepares for winter, the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) recently reported 1.7 gigawatts (GW) worth of Large Flexible Loads primarily composed of Bitcoin miners to help state grid operators manage periods of high demand. The interactions between miners and governments at the local, state, and possibly federal level could continue to accelerate in 2023. \nOn the operational side, miners will likely need to continue to monitor input costs in the face of higher industrial electricity rates. Large operators with competitive rates in advantageous locations optimizing over every variable are poised to succeed in this environment. Further maturation and technical upgrades next year could benefit the ecosystem, such as the impending launch of Stratum V2.\nThere are plenty of challenges, but in the face of it all miners continue to hash away, securing the chain while cleverly positioning operations for success and survival.\nCoin Metrics Updates\nThis week’s updates from the Coin Metrics team:\n\nJoin us on The Mining Pod on December 21st, where we’ll provide a recap of Bitcoin mining data in 2022.\n\nWe're excited to be growing our data and research-focused community on gm.xyz, come join the conversation!\n\nCheck out our market-data focused newsletter State of the Market, featuring weekly updates on market conditions and news across the crypto ecosystem.\n\nAs always, if you have any feedback or requests please let us know here.\nSubscribe and Past Issues\nCoin Metrics’ State of the Network, is an unbiased, weekly view of the crypto market informed by our own network (on-chain) and market data.\nIf you'd like to get State of the Network in your inbox, please subscribe here.

They were great for our business and even better for our understanding. Of course we expect every feature to boost usage, but we couldn’t have anticipated the growth yielded by those two features. And the correlation was easy to analyze: both features directly implement a vision of the P2P economy.</p><p>The P2P economy refers to disintermediated exchange, like creative people trading the fruits of their creativity — podcasts, videos, fanfic novels, 3D-printed cosplay accessories — with users for cash, without the intervention of banks, payment processors, or aggregators.</p><p>Each intermediary in an interaction induces friction and increases the distance from the desired experience, and they can’t help it. Banks have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Aggregation platforms have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Payment processors have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit.</p><p>Notice the pattern? While each intermediary claims to be giving users what they want, they’re actually serving different groups who want different things at the same time. That intermediaries always take a cut, induce friction, and increase the distance between people and experiences isn’t the result of bad management or evil intentions, it’s just the nature of the beast.</p><p>So why not create something far better for users? Let people interact directly, pay each other directly, exchange goods and services directly. There are even services out there — social networks, messaging services, content aggregators, gaming platforms — that would like to facilitate exchanges among their users, but they can’t because legacy intermediaries induce too much (financial, regulatory, UX) friction. Worse still, the centralization induced by these large data networks increases their power over each user and, therefore, increases the risk of abuse to all users.</p><p>The P2P economy isn’t some billionaire’s pipe dream; it describes a world where we’re closer to the experiences we value and to each other.

While both of those functions are in the Breez app, they feel like their own little self-contained interfaces, tailor-made for their respective purposes (or as close as we could get with the technological limitations of running a node on a phone).</p><p>But you can only cram so many activities and experiences into a <a href=\"https://medium.com/breez-technology/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-lightning-wallet-dc9ac46d32\">non-custodial Lightning payment app</a>. And however clever, charming, and good looking a team behind the payment app may be, they’re not necessarily best placed to devise new ways of applying P2P payments to new types of experience. We know how to make Lightning mobile and how to improve its UX, but when it comes to commerce, music, video streaming, or any other vertical solution, experts in those fields know better how to craft the best experience.</p><p>Indeed, the POS mode and the podcast player are just scratching the surface of what’s possible. We implemented them according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\">the KISS principle</a>. Though they have scaled remarkably and attracted thousands of new users, they’re basically demo versions implemented to showcase how people interface with the P2P economy.</p><p>Could others with fine-grained expertise of those and other kinds of experience come up with better ways to apply P2P money to P2P interaction? <em>Of course they could</em>. And would those better applications achieve scale that our neophyte, outsider attempts never could? <em>Absolutely</em>.</p><p>And that’s the point. The better we apply the tech, the closer people get to the experiences they want, the more they will use the tech, the faster Lightning will scale. The scale we’re aiming for is not X orders of magnitude; we’re shooting for a world where kids roll their eyes whenever an adult says “Back in the fiat days…”</p><p>Achieving scale is a matter of reducing friction, and multiple, tailor-made apps that apply Lightning technology optimally to life’s many worthwhile pursuits is the best way of minimizing friction and expanding the P2P economy. It’s not about making the best wallet that can do everything; it’s about adapting Lightning — the means — to whatever ends users want and whatever kind of experience they want in exchange.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*VAZ6woKIBYlUtlWA\" /><figcaption>(Image: <a href=\"https://singularityhub.com/2016/04/05/how-to-think-exponentially-and-better-predict-the-future/\">Alison E. Berman</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>LaaS Liberates Lightning</h3><p>Those who understand the technical requirements of running a non-custodial Lightning app will have realized already that adapting Lightning payments to any number of existing and yet-unimagined applications is incompatible with running a node in a single app. Lightning is far too technically demanding to scale the P2P economy as we have described it. Running the kind of always-on node required is an experience that few users, developers, creators, or vendors out there will relish.</p><p>We’re envisioning, inventing, and realizing <strong>Lightning as a Service </strong>(LaaS). LaaS is about using Lightning to remove friction from life, from the experiences we crave. The point isn’t to improve the user experience <em>in the app</em>, but to improve the users’ experience <em>of Lightning as a whole</em> that gives them more value in their lives.</p><p>And LaaS is doable. As Breez envisions it, LaaS has three major components, the first of which is in development, the second has an alpha set to launch in a couple of months, and the third exists already and just needs to scale:</p><h4>A Lightning SDK</h4><p>As it stands, anyone seeking to integrate Lightning payments to their existing business faces a steep learning curve. Accepting payments over Lightning requires them to run a node, secure liquidity with an LSP, manage fiat exchanges, perform swaps on and off the Bitcoin blockchain, manage a wallet, and so on. A non-custodial SDK would give P2P entrepreneurs and existing web utilities access to those functions without having to start from scratch.</p><p>With a well-designed SDK, developers will be able to select the Lightning functions they need from a menu and integrate them quickly and easily into their own applications. Instead of having to learn the Lightning tech stack, a Lightning SDK will let developers simply plug it into their own tech stacks.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-Sgz6UfiUL-LHU1s\" /></figure><h4>Hybrid architecture</h4><p>Lightning needs to be immediately available wherever and whenever people want to make payments. Locking a user’s functionality into a single app or on a single device would require the user to adapt to the technology, which is backwards. That’s friction.</p><p>At the same time, though, KYC friction and global, cross-market expansion requires a peer-to-peer, non-custodial solution. As soon as LSPs start acting like banks, regulators will start treating them like banks. That’s friction too.</p><p>The solution is a hybrid architecture based on <a href=\"https://medium.com/breez-technology/get-ready-for-a-fresh-breez-multiple-apps-one-node-optimal-ux-519c4daf2536\">sovereign remote nodes</a>, but that locates those nodes in the cloud rather than on users’ local devices. To deliver both optimal user sovereignty with a next-gen UX, we’ve partnered with Blockstream and their <a href=\"https://blog.blockstream.com/en-greenlight-by-blockstream-lightning-made-easy/\">Greenlight product</a>. Any service can access these nodes from any device, but as long as the users’ keys are locally stored, users maintain custody of their own funds, minimizing the operators’ regulatory profile.</p><p>P2P + minimal friction = scale.</p><h4>Decentralizing liquidity</h4><p>There is no credit on Lightning. The liquidity to settle any transaction needs to be preloaded onto the network. While this imposes a significant liquidity burden on those seeking to process users’ payments, it also presents the rich opportunity of a snowball effect: the more liquidity the network contains, the more transactions it can process, the more transaction fees the operators can collect, the more liquidity they have to invest in the network, and so on.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.lynalden.com/lightning-network/\">Lyn Alden</a> recently put it,</p><blockquote>Once there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of participants, and with larger average channel balances, then routing a payment from any arbitrary point to any other arbitrary point on the network becomes exponentially easier and more reliable.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xIHhDYxMFyFXI3iN\" /><figcaption>Ironically, snowballs are only possible when water is frozen, i.e. <em>not liquid</em>.
