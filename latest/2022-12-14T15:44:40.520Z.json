This year I wanted to try it myself so I could see if I have what it takes. After watching all the previous videos, I thought “OK, I’ll give it a go!”…</p><p>It was a great opportunity for me to test my speed and what I can build in 10 min in Webflow. Webflow is an incredible software for designers who love drag and drop. It allows you to create websites, including CMS, web apps, and templates.</p><p>Here are my top 8 lessons that I learned from this challenge-</p><ol><li><strong>Creativity</strong> The creative process is one of the most important parts of the project. This can be anything from a cool intro to a killer animation or a beautiful storyboard. The Webflow team provided us with some assets and Lottie animations that were to be used in the project. We weren’t allowed to use anything else. Using just these assets we had to show how creative we could get. With a great concept that can wow your audience, it doesn’t matter whether you build it in 3 min or more. e.g, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaisOfficial\">Shais</a> created ellipses on cursor movement in the qualifiers round in 5 min and managed to win everyone’s attention.</li><li><strong>Understand Webflow</strong> For this challenge, you need to know the tool inside out. You need to know the shortcuts with the keyboard to get faster and learn different aspects of Webflow to get creative. Many participants were using blend mode, blur, 3d perspective, transform, etc. to express their creativity. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kckatcreative\">KC</a> used a cat and added a blur effect to make it a cloud for her prompt on the Weather card UI in the semi-final round.</li><li><strong>Animation</strong> This year Webflow wanted to test how familiar you are with the interaction panel. This challenge helped me explore different types of animations that I could use in my projects. I had never used mouse movement before but during my practice sessions, I explored how to use this interaction. I went through a couple of “Made in Webflow” projects to find inspiration and learn how animations work. But the idea of the challenge was to keep your interactions simple yet creative, as you have got a time limit. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fxayuan\">Felixander Yuan</a> used many of the native Webflow interactions in his projects to go that extra mile.</li><li><strong>Practice</strong> It’s all about practice. The more you practice, the better, faster, and more confident you become. With practice, you start using the keyboard shortcuts efficiently and have more time to be creative with your build. It’s important to remember that you’ll make mistakes when you are on a live stage. But if you practice your build, you reduce the chances of error.</li><li><strong>Room for error</strong> When you are on the live stage you get nervous, and with the time limit, you always make errors when building the project. Instead of panicking, the idea is to overcome those errors. If possible, preview your project before the time limit ends, to make sure everything is working as planned.</li><li><strong>Get inspired</strong> At the end of the challenge, it was inspiring to see what all the challengers came up with their ideas, given the restriction of images and Lottie animations. Watching their projects broke the limitations of my creative imagination and inspired me to go even further.</li><li><strong>Reflection</strong> To be honest, when you are on the live stage you shake from the inside with nervousness and excitement. During the live stage, your mindset is important because many times we plan something else but execute differently. But once it’s over, you feel a different sense of achievement. You might feel that you could have done better or something different, but that’s the whole point. This challenge helped me reflect on what could have been better or different. It helped me reflect on my skills and knowledge.</li><li><strong>Have fun</strong> In the end, even if you don’t win the challenge, the bonus point is you get to know the other challengers and the Webflow community. You get inspired to learn more, do more and go beyond your imagination.</li></ol><p>I didn’t participate to win, I participated to test my capabilities and imagination.

[1/3]</a></p><p>In this part, we will dig deep into the course material that is appropriate to teach seniors.</p><h3>2. Course material</h3><p>In this section, I explained the materials that we taught in the classroom. We had to change and adjust the material as we went forward. I also explained the things that we learned and subjects that we found important for seniors. We also identified a couple of confusing topics and a couple of fun subjects. You can see the material that we taught below.</p><h4>1. Explain all the basics.</h4><figure><img alt=\"Explain all the basics.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*V_DfGlDYkjpO6MNLdVZBpg.gif\" /></figure><p>The whole concept of the internet, browses, tabs, and URLs was a confusing subject for them. You can make examples to make it easier to understand. For the URL, we explained it as an address in blue format. For the browser, we explained it as the door to the internet. The tabs were a little trickier. We said that your browser is getting doubled. Although we explained these concepts a lot (pretty much in every session😅), I’m sure that I couldn’t pass that knowledge to them to the degree that I wanted.</p><h4>2. Explain bookmarks.</h4><figure><img alt=\"Screen shot of bookmarks.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/845/0*JSwoTyac93OciiVy.png\" /><figcaption>Image by <a href=\"https://www.maketecheasier.com/keep-bookmarks-organized-chrome/\">maketecheasier.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Most seniors use the internet to do these things:</p><ul><li>Read the news.</li><li>Checking town events.</li><li>Play online games.</li><li>Attending online video calls.</li><li>Checking Facebook.</li><li>Sending and receiving pictures from their family and friends.</li></ul><p>Bookmarks can significantly help them find these things easier. Help them set up bookmarks for their most used pages.</p><h4>3. Explain passwords.</h4><figure><img alt=\"Explain passwords.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*0-0Fbb62Jllxw5cb-xZn3w.gif\" /></figure><p>All of them had frustrations with their password. Let’s face it; it even bothers us. But for them, it’s much more severe. Some of them don’t know the exact meaning of the username and password. They might confuse the application password with their device password. And almost all of them forget their password, and sometimes it’s impossible to retrieve because they forgot multiple passwords. They have different approaches to their passwords. Some of them write them in a notebook. Some have sticky notes on their devices. And none of them knows anything about password managers. So this is a key concept to teach. If they learn about that, they can automatically store their passwords, and it will be more accessible when they change devices.</p><h4>4. Explain icons.</h4><p>These Icons that we all know and believe are pretty clear were a big mystery for almost all of the seniors in the class. They always referred to them as symbols. And one of them told us how we suppose to know what’s the meaning of these signs and symbols.</p><p>This question hit me! I always thought icons were easy to understand. Seniors asked us to recommend a book with all those signs. I knew I couldn’t find one. Who writes a book about icons and their meaning? So I had to create a document for them myself. When I was preparing that document, I realized that many icons have the same appearance, but their meaning is different based on the context. It’s funny that we don’t pay attention to these details because we get used to them. Below you can see the document I created based on material design icons.</p><figure><img alt=\"material design icons list for print.

Many of them aren’t used to keyboards. (Unless they have been typists before, we had a grandma who could type very fast with ten fingures😎) They don’t know about autocorrect, autocomplete features, and voice commands. If you teach these to them, they would be revealed that they don’t have to type everything character per character. Especially the voice commands for searching addresses in Google Maps or searching on the internet. They might forget that in the next session, but keep reminding them that they don’t have to type everything.</p><h4>6. Teach Google Maps.</h4><figure><img alt=\"Teach Google Maps.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*-bw0cUype7_GHbYMns0vqw.gif\" /></figure><p>The session, we talked about Google Maps, was great. All of them find it very interesting and helpful. They were fascinated by the features and how easy it is to find an address and see the 360-degree location images on Google Street View.

Some of them are familiar with it to some degree. Bus some have no idea about it. Cover these topics in Email sessions:</p><ul><li>How to write an Email and send it.</li><li>How to attach something to an Email.</li><li>How to reply to an Email.</li><li>How to forward an Email.</li></ul><p>Don’t mention other details. Just cover the basics and ask them to do it a couple of times. The process of creating the Email is challenging for them to do. Do it yourself, and just teach them briefly how to log in. Even the login is not that important because their device stored that info, and when they want to change their device, they probably forget what you taught them.</p><figure><img alt=\"Gmail workbook first page -Senior Center Internet Course — By Sepideh Yazdi-sepidy\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/880/1*Q6CMOJ_0C_zcwaDCi1ucmQ.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"Gmail workbook second page -Senior Center Internet Course — By Sepideh Yazdi-sepidy.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/876/1*VlCbGIIQ06_iFY2NWeKzEg.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"Gmail workbook third page -Senior Center Internet Course — By Sepideh Yazdi-sepidy.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/881/1*5ZEjau6Ow1pOaSLAlzRepg.png\" /><figcaption>Three pages of the Google Maps workbook by <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/c2c891fcb5d9\">Sepideh Yazdi</a></figcaption></figure><h4>8. Short brief about streaming services.</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*Mybktj2X7H7AEp7WgXb2eA.gif\" /></figure><p>Most seniors have free time, and it’s fun for them to learn how they can use online entertainment. So we decided to teach a short brief about different streaming services. Unfortunately, we didn’t have much time to cover all the parts. We just introduced a couple of stream services to them. Most of them knew about Youtube, but they didn’t know how the subscription works and what values are offered. Their main question was why we should get a message for premium activation all the time and whether it is worth the money.</p><p>We introduced services for movies and music. They wanted to know whether they could find old movies and old classic songs or not. When we explained they could, they were thrilled. We helped one of them find an old TV series online, and she was so happy about it. So if you want to make your grandparents happy, help them find their favorite old movies or songs! You can’t imagine how glad they will be when they see those things.</p><h3>Summary</h3><figure><img alt=\"Course materials Summary of Part 2 — by Sepideh Yazdi — sepidy.com\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z6gTz0Kndsmtc1s_kbJEIA.png\" /><figcaption>Summary of part 2 — Important points while teaching — by <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/c2c891fcb5d9\">Sepideh Yazdi</a></figcaption></figure><p>This is the end of the <strong>second part</strong> of this <strong>three-part series</strong>.

It’s about understanding how to add value to the person you want to reach out to, so you stand out from all the other people who want the same thing.</p><p>In other words, the strategy is about learning how to get what you want, by learning how to get people what they want.</p><h4><strong>3 steps to make it work</strong></h4><ol><li>Know where you are</li></ol><p>Be humble and recognize that the person you want to connect with may have more experience, knowledge, and status. In the opposite way, if you’ve been a designer for a while, there are people ‘below’ you who have less knowledge and experience because they’re just starting out. It’s important you are completely honest with yourself here. Recognize and accept your current situation. You should not act as if you have years of experience if you are just starting out, but you should also avoid undervaluing yourself. The sooner you do this, the sooner you will be able to advance in your career.</p><p>2. Do your research</p><p>Assume you want to contact someone who has your dream job. You might wonder, “Why would this person want to contact me?” Or worse, you never considered this and simply sent the person a generic message like every other designer out there. That’s where research comes in.</p><p>You’re putting work on this person if you send a general message about what you can do for them or if you can meet. You are also unlikely to get a response. Instead, do some research on what this person might be looking for and think of a way to add value.</p><p>3. Do it</p><p>After you’ve come up with something that adds value to this person, put it into action without expecting anything in return. Make that redesign, address this person’s frustrations, or connect with someone this person wants to meet.</p><h3>Show your work</h3><p>Show your work on the internet. This is important because it allows people to find you. You are developing your personal brand by putting things out there. It shows who you are, and you may be surprised at how many people approach you. Opportunities often come from unexpected places.</p><figure><img alt=\"Girl leaning against a sofa while sitting on the ground with her laptop.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XR_I4NyWmC-PGNgL\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@thoughtcatalog?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Thought Catalog</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>If you believe you have nothing interesting to say, think again. What is obvious to you may be amazing for others. It doesn’t have to be anything big or special. Start by sharing some content on LinkedIn, for example. When you share some first things, the bar for further sharing is often lowered, and you may surprise yourself.</p><h3>Be genuine</h3><p>Don’t get too caught up in all the network-building advice. You’re probably thinking, “But you just gave me those?” I’m not saying that knowing about the various ways you can do this isn’t useful, but when you’re out there connecting with people, you should just show genuine interest and get to know them. It’s not fair to act as if you’re interested in the person you’re speaking with. In addition, to make a situation like that work, you must be an incredible actor. When people notice you’re not interested, the conversation will die out and both sides will have wasted energy.</p><p>Focus on adding value to the other person rather than what you want from them. Develop a desire to meet interesting people. Both parties will benefit in the end, so just enjoy it.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=15e487bb76db\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://uxplanet.org/portfolio-didnt-use-it-still-got-the-job-15e487bb76db\">Portfolio: didn’t use it, still got the job</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://uxplanet.org\">UX Planet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Why a portfolio isn’t everything and how you do get that job.\nI used to think a good portfolio was everything.

The sooner you do this, the sooner you will be able to advance in your career.\n2. Do your research\nAssume you want to contact someone who has your dream job. You might wonder, “Why would this person want to contact me?” Or worse, you never considered this and simply sent the person a generic message like every other designer out there. That’s where research comes in.\nYou’re putting work on this person if you send a general message about what you can do for them or if you can meet. You are also unlikely to get a response. Instead, do some research on what this person might be looking for and think of a way to add value.\n3. Do it\nAfter you’ve come up with something that adds value to this person, put it into action without expecting anything in return. Make that redesign, address this person’s frustrations, or connect with someone this person wants to meet.\nShow your work\nShow your work on the internet. This is important because it allows people to find you. You are developing your personal brand by putting things out there. It shows who you are, and you may be surprised at how many people approach you. Opportunities often come from unexpected places.\nPhoto by Thought Catalog on Unsplash\nIf you believe you have nothing interesting to say, think again. What is obvious to you may be amazing for others. It doesn’t have to be anything big or special. Start by sharing some content on LinkedIn, for example. When you share some first things, the bar for further sharing is often lowered, and you may surprise yourself.\nBe genuine\nDon’t get too caught up in all the network-building advice. You’re probably thinking, “But you just gave me those?” I’m not saying that knowing about the various ways you can do this isn’t useful, but when you’re out there connecting with people, you should just show genuine interest and get to know them. It’s not fair to act as if you’re interested in the person you’re speaking with. In addition, to make a situation like that work, you must be an incredible actor. When people notice you’re not interested, the conversation will die out and both sides will have wasted energy.\nFocus on adding value to the other person rather than what you want from them. Develop a desire to meet interesting people. Both parties will benefit in the end, so just enjoy it.\n\nPortfolio: didn’t use it, still got the job was originally published in UX Planet on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Sanne Eikelboom","guid":"https://medium.com/p/15e487bb76db","categories":["ux-design","user-experience","product-design","ux","design"],"isoDate":"2022-12-14T14:41:06.000Z","from":"https://uxplanet.org/feed","hashId":"e1a5b424b736f68a9f8ef5288580f900"},{"creator":"Ruben Ferreira Duarte","title":"Not all deadlines are to be taken seriously","link":"https://uxplanet.org/not-all-deadlines-are-to-be-taken-seriously-c7feb5c9a1ae?source=rss----819cc2aaeee0---4","pubDate":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 14:47:03 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>Think more about the strategy than the calendar</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4ayUH9zMcJxAk-qLJxwc7A.jpeg\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jontyson\">© Jon Tyson</a></figcaption></figure><p>It is not uncommon for the daunting deadlines of many projects to be the terror of any design team.

Through user research, we can answer important questions about our design, such as <em>Who are our users?</em> and <em>What do they need?</em></p><p>In this blog post, we will discuss six common user research methods, what they are, when to use them, and some common challenges associated with each one.</p><p>Let’s get started …</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/user-research-methods/#whatis\">What is User Research?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/user-research-methods/#whyis\">Why is User Research Integral to the UX Process?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/user-research-methods/#methods\">6 Common User Research Methods</a></li><li><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/user-research-methods/#getstarted\">How To Get Started With User Research In UX Design Projects</a></li><li><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/user-research-methods/#key\">Key Takeaways</a></li></ul><h3>What is User Research?</h3><p><strong>User research is a process of gathering data about users in order to design better products that meet their needs</strong>.</p><p>It’s used in every part of the design process, from the initial market research and concepting stages, through the final interface design testing and iteration stages.</p><p><strong>The goal:</strong> to gather data that will allow you to make informed decisions as you create design solutions.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*j4sI1kRSQqEN1jWF.jpg\" /></figure><h4>Term Check: User Research vs. UX Research</h4><p>Depending on what you read, you might come across the terms <strong>user research</strong>, <strong>UX research</strong>, or simply <strong>design research</strong> — all used interchangeably.</p><p>While they all tend to refer to the process of collecting user-centric data, there is some distinction that can be applied:</p><p>The term <strong>user research</strong> is often used when you want to learn more about the target audience for a product or service; who they are, how they think, what their goals are, etc.</p><p><strong>UX research</strong>, on the other hand, tends to be used when you’re conducting research that focuses on how users interact with a product or service.</p><p>In this article, we’ll be looking at user research holistically, whether specifically talking about the users themselves, or learning more about how they interact with and experience your design work.</p><h3>Why is User Research Integral to the UX Process?</h3><p>User research is an integral part of the design process: it ensures you have enough <a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/what-is-data-driven-design/\">data and insights</a> to make informed decisions about the design work you produce, reducing the risk of making assumptions and creating something no one truly wants.</p><p>Successful UX design requires a deep understanding of the people who will be using your product and how they interact with it. No matter how experienced you are as a designer, there is no way to validate your assumptions about design solutions without data. And the only way to acquire this understanding is by collecting data from the users themselves.</p><h3>6 Common User Research Methods</h3><p>There are a variety of user research methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are 6 common methodologies that are easy to incorporate into your UX design process.</p><h4>1. User Interviews</h4><p>Interviews are a type of user research method in which the researcher talks with participants to collect data. This method is used to gather insights about people’s attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and experiences. Interviews are a great way to gather in-depth, <a href=\"https://designlab.com/ux-glossary/what-is-qualitative-data/\">qualitative data</a> from users.</p><p>Interviews are best conducted in a live conversation, whether that takes place in person, on a video call, or even on the phone. They can be structured or unstructured, depending on what best fits your research needs:</p><ul><li><strong>Structured interviews</strong> follow a set list of questions</li><li><strong>Unstructured interviews</strong> are intended for more open-ended conversation</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p><p>When deciding whether to use interviews as a user research method, it is important to consider the goals of the research, the target audience, and the availability of resources. Interviews are extremely time-consuming, both for the interviewer and the interviewee. However, if the goal of the research is to observe behavior in a natural setting, or if the target audience is not available to participate in interviews, then another user research method may be more appropriate.</p><h4>2. Surveys</h4><p>Surveys are a user research method in which participants are asked to answer a series of questions, usually about a specific topic. Surveys are well suited for collecting data that can be quantified, but they are not as well suited for collecting qualitative data, since answers are often nuanced and lack appropriate context.</p><p><strong>Surveys are best used when …</strong></p><p>Since surveys can be easily distributed to a large number of people, they’re often a good choice for gathering information from people who might not be able — or willing — to participate in other types of user research (such as usability testing).</p><p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p><p>Since surveys rely on self-reported data, it’s important to avoid phrases or words that might influence the users’ answers. Furthermore, this type of user research often provides data without context, since you aren’t able to follow up and understand some of the nuances of the responses.</p><h4>3. Focus Groups</h4><p>Focus groups are a type of user research method in which a group of people are brought together to discuss a product, service, or experience. Focus groups provide an opportunity for users to discuss their experiences and opinions with each other in a guided setting. When done correctly, focus groups can provide valuable insights that can help shape both product design and marketing strategies.</p><p><strong>Focus groups are best used when …</strong></p><p>Focus groups can help uncover user needs and perspectives that may not be apparent through individual interviews or surveys.</p><p><strong>Tips to make it work:</strong></p><p>To get the most out of a focus group, it is important to carefully select participants that are representative of the target audience, as well as those who represent various accessibility needs, which might otherwise be overlooked or receive less consideration. The moderator should also be skilled in leading discussions and facilitating group dynamics to avoid participants from influencing each other.</p><h4>4. A/B Testing</h4><p>A/B testing is a user research method in which two versions of a design are created, then tested against each other to determine which is more effective.</p><p>These versions can be identical except for one small change, or they can be completely different. Once the two versions have been created, they are then assigned to users at random. The results of the test are then analyzed to see which version was more successful.</p><p><strong>A/B testing is best used when …</strong></p><p>You can incorporate A/B testing at any stage of the design process, but you might find you get the most helpful insights when you’re in a state of refinement, or are at a crossroads and need some data to help you decide which route to take.</p><p><strong>Tips to make it work:</strong></p><p>Once you have your design variations ready to test, it’s up to the developers (or an A/B testing software program) to make the test live to users. It’s important to let the test run long enough so that any statistical significance is steady and repeatable. (If the test does not provide statistically significant results, it’s time to go back to the drawing board and try out a different variation.)</p><h4>5. Card Sorting</h4><p>Card sorting is a user research method that can be used to help understand how people think about the items in a given category. Card sorting involves providing users with a set of cards, each of which contains an item from the category, and asking them to sort the cards into groups. The groups can be based on any criteria that the users choose, and the sorted cards can then be analyzed to identify patterns in the way that the users think about the items. Card sorting can be used with both small and large sets of items, making it a versatile tool for user research.</p><p><strong>Card sorting is best used when …</strong></p><p>You are looking for insight into categorical questions like how to structure the <a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/guide-to-information-architecture/\">information architecture</a> of a website.</p><p>For example, if you were designing a website for a library, you might use card sorting to understand how users would expect the website’s content to be organized.</p><p><strong>Tips to make it work:</strong></p><p>Like the other research methods mentioned so far, a successful card sorting exercise requires a significant amount of thought and setup ahead of time. You might use an <strong>open sorting session</strong>, where the users create their own categories, if you want insight into the grouping logic of your users. In a <strong>closed sorting session</strong>, the categories are already defined, but it’s up to the participants to decide where to file each card.</p><h4>6. Tree Test</h4><p>Tree testing is a user research method that helps evaluate the findability and usability of website content. It is often used as a follow-up to card sorting, or when there are large amounts of website content, multiple website navigation structures, or changes to an existing website.</p><p>To conduct a tree test, participants are asked to find specific items on a website, starting from the home page. They are not told what the navigation options are, but are given hints if they get stuck. This helps researchers understand how users find and interact with the website content.</p><p><strong>Tree testing is best used when …</strong></p><p>This method is most effective when combined with other user research methods, such as interviews, surveys, and focus groups. This is because it’s really a way to finesse the user’s experience at the end of the design process, rather than a method of collecting the preliminary data that’s needed to arrive at this point.</p><p><strong>Tips to make it work:</strong></p><p>Tree testing can be a challenging method to conduct, as it requires specific instructions and data collection methods for each test. In addition, participants may not use the same navigation paths that you intended, making it difficult to analyze the results. To account for this, it’s important to have a large enough sample size to be able to differentiate between outliers and general trends.</p><h3>How To Get Started With User Research In UX Design Projects</h3><p>User research is a critical part of any project or product development process.

Through user research, we can answer important questions about our design, such as Who are our users? and What do they need?\nIn this blog post, we will discuss six common user research methods, what they are, when to use them, and some common challenges associated with each one.\nLet’s get started …\n\nWhat is User Research?\nWhy is User Research Integral to the UX Process?\n6 Common User Research Methods\nHow To Get Started With User Research In UX Design Projects\nKey Takeaways\n\nWhat is User Research?\nUser research is a process of gathering data about users in order to design better products that meet their needs.\nIt’s used in every part of the design process, from the initial market research and concepting stages, through the final interface design testing and iteration stages.\nThe goal: to gather data that will allow you to make informed decisions as you create design solutions.\n\nTerm Check: User Research vs. UX Research\nDepending on what you read, you might come across the terms user research, UX research, or simply design research — all used interchangeably.\nWhile they all tend to refer to the process of collecting user-centric data, there is some distinction that can be applied:\nThe term user research is often used when you want to learn more about the target audience for a product or service; who they are, how they think, what their goals are, etc.\nUX research, on the other hand, tends to be used when you’re conducting research that focuses on how users interact with a product or service.\nIn this article, we’ll be looking at user research holistically, whether specifically talking about the users themselves, or learning more about how they interact with and experience your design work.\nWhy is User Research Integral to the UX Process?\nUser research is an integral part of the design process: it ensures you have enough data and insights to make informed decisions about the design work you produce, reducing the risk of making assumptions and creating something no one truly wants.\nSuccessful UX design requires a deep understanding of the people who will be using your product and how they interact with it. No matter how experienced you are as a designer, there is no way to validate your assumptions about design solutions without data. And the only way to acquire this understanding is by collecting data from the users themselves.\n6 Common User Research Methods\nThere are a variety of user research methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are 6 common methodologies that are easy to incorporate into your UX design process.\n1.
