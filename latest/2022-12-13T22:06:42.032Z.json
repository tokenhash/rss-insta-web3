After only having 7.82% market share of the bitcoin supply on exchanges in 2018, their share is now 27.50% despite a much broader trend of bitcoin supply leaving exchanges. The bitcoin balance on Binance now totals 595,864 BTC, which is 3.1% of outstanding supply, worth $10.58 billion. This bitcoin belongs to their customers and reflects a growing trend in market share over the last few years that has made Binance the largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>As highlighted previously in &#8220;<a href=\"https://bmpro.substack.com/p/the-exchange-war-binance-smells-blood\">The Exchange War: Binance Smells Blood As FTX/Alameda Rumors Mount</a>,&#8221; Binance now controls approximately <a href=\"https://bmpro.substack.com/p/the-exchange-war-binance-smells-blood\">60% of the spot and derivatives volume</a> in the entire market as well. It&#8217;s hard to see how any exchange in the space can be a &#8220;winner&#8221; in the current market conditions, but one could make the case for Binance, with the exchange&#8217;s growing strength in a decimated industry. On top of that, Binance&#8217;s BNB token, the native currency of Binance&#8217;s own Ethereum-competing Layer 1 blockchain, is still one of the better performing tokens when valued in bitcoin terms this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, is this recent &#8220;strength&#8221; everything that it seems or is it a facade? We&#8217;ve learned over the last month that no company is safe in this industry right now (especially exchanges) and questions are growing around Binance&#8217;s practices, solvency, BNB token value and the overall state of their business over the last few weeks. Is it FUD or legit? Let&#8217;s try to break some of it down, addressing the concerns through an objective and skeptical lens.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><strong>Interview appearance</strong>: Bitcoin Magazine PRO Head of Market Research <strong>Dylan LeClair</strong> appeared on <strong>The Bitcoin Standard Podcast</strong> to talk with host Dr. Saifedean Ammous to discuss the many crypto Ponzi schemes and the red flags he saw with Terra/LUNA, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, BlockFi, FTX and Genesis.</p></blockquote><div id=\"youtube2-T8tVO5Ws1io\" class=\"youtube-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;T8tVO5Ws1io&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T8tVO5Ws1io?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowautoplay=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\"></iframe></div></div><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/T8tVO5Ws1io&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Watch Full Interview&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://youtu.be/T8tVO5Ws1io\"><span>Watch Full Interview</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h4>Binance Flows</h4><p>Over the last day, we&#8217;ve seen significant outflows from Binance across different various tokens and bitcoin when looking at both <a href=\"https://twitter.com/themlpx/status/1602567600483205125?s=20&amp;t=O5hgOya8eEjD2QUHMv6Mcg\">Nansen</a> and Glassnode tracking.

After only having 7.82% market share of the bitcoin supply on exchanges in 2018, their share is now 27.50% despite a much broader trend of bitcoin supply leaving exchanges. The bitcoin balance on Binance now totals 595,864 BTC, which is 3.1% of outstanding supply, worth $10.58 billion. This bitcoin belongs to their customers and reflects a growing trend in market share over the last few years that has made Binance the largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange in the world. \nAs highlighted previously in “The Exchange War: Binance Smells Blood As FTX/Alameda Rumors Mount,” Binance now controls approximately 60% of the spot and derivatives volume in the entire market as well. It’s hard to see how any exchange in the space can be a “winner” in the current market conditions, but one could make the case for Binance, with the exchange’s growing strength in a decimated industry. On top of that, Binance’s BNB token, the native currency of Binance’s own Ethereum-competing Layer 1 blockchain, is still one of the better performing tokens when valued in bitcoin terms this year. \nYet, is this recent “strength” everything that it seems or is it a facade? We’ve learned over the last month that no company is safe in this industry right now (especially exchanges) and questions are growing around Binance’s practices, solvency, BNB token value and the overall state of their business over the last few weeks. Is it FUD or legit? Let’s try to break some of it down, addressing the concerns through an objective and skeptical lens. \n\n\nInterview appearance: Bitcoin Magazine PRO Head of Market Research Dylan LeClair appeared on The Bitcoin Standard Podcast to talk with host Dr. Saifedean Ammous to discuss the many crypto Ponzi schemes and the red flags he saw with Terra/LUNA, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, BlockFi, FTX and Genesis.\n\n\n\nWatch Full Interview\n\n\nBinance Flows\nOver the last day, we’ve seen significant outflows from Binance across different various tokens and bitcoin when looking at both Nansen and Glassnode tracking. Across ETH and ERC20 tokens, Binance saw $3 billion leaving the exchange in its largest single-day outflow since June. Across Nansen total wallet tracking, all Binance balances are estimated at $62.5 billion with around 50% of those balances in stablecoins across BUSD and USDT. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Nansen \nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Nansen\n\n\nIn case you missed it: Bitcoin Magazine PRO hosted Cory Klippsten to discuss the prepared remarks for the FTX congressional testimony, the state of Binance and what will cause the next wave of bitcoin adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to Spaces\n\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the total bitcoin exchange balance on Binance is down around 6-7% over the last day, after reaching a peak on December 1. Although balances remain above 500,000 bitcoin and Binance has shown a rising trend of bitcoin balances on the platform this year, this is a significant move for outflows in just 24 hours. The largest one-day change in bitcoin outflows was just shy of 4% back in July.  As a general comparison, the trend of bitcoin exchange balances was a much different story for FTX, whose balance had been falling heavily since June. \nNote that in some of the charts below, exchange balances are using daily data from Glassnode instead of 10-minute or 1-hour intervals where we can see more of the latest bitcoin exchange outflows.

Its largest ETF upped its position in Coinbase last week as centralized exchanges seek to offer more transparency in the wake of <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/whats-next-for-ftx-and-its-customers-after-bankruptcy-filing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FTX filing for bankruptcy</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fund manager bought 78,982 shares of Coinbase for its <a href=\"https://ark-funds.com/funds/arkk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK)</a> — a position that represented nearly 0.05% of the fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase’s stock price — down about 84% year to date — was down about 9% Tuesday, as of 4:00 pm ET, setting a new low for the shares since the firm’s 2021 listing on the Nasdaq.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ARKK has nearly $7.7 billion in assets under management. The ETF is down about 64% year to date and down about 9% over the past month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase stock made up 3.53% of ARKK, as of Tuesday — ranking 14th-highest of the ETF’s 31 holdings.

Its largest ETF upped its position in Coinbase last week as centralized exchanges seek to offer more transparency in the wake of FTX filing for bankruptcy.\nThe fund manager bought 78,982 shares of Coinbase for its Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) — a position that represented nearly 0.05% of the fund.\nCoinbase’s stock price — down about 84% year to date — was down about 9% Tuesday, as of 4:00 pm ET, setting a new low for the shares since the firm’s 2021 listing on the Nasdaq.\nARKK has nearly $7.7 billion in assets under management. The ETF is down about 64% year to date and down about 9% over the past month.\nCoinbase stock made up 3.53% of ARKK, as of Tuesday — ranking 14th-highest of the ETF’s 31 holdings. The Coinbase shares in the fund have a market value of roughly $250 million.\nAn Ark Invest spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.\nOwen Lau, an executive director at Oppenheimer & Co., told Blockworks that the overall sentiment for Coinbase is weak after the collapse of FTX.
