Where do we go from here? How do we identify the people behind this alleged scam? Simple: Like the old maxim says, we follow the money. Using Reactor, we can look at where EmpiresX sends the funds it takes in, and thanks to the permanence and transparency of the blockchain, we can do it faster and more comprehensively than we could in a traditional financial investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of any crypto scammer is to eventually convert the stolen funds back into fiat currency they can spend, but this can only be done through centralized cryptocurrency exchanges — think common brand names like Coinbase and Kraken — all of whom are subject to anti-money laundering (AML) compliance procedures like Know-Your-Customer (KYC), similar to banks. We can look through EmpiresX’s transaction history in Reactor to find instances of its wallet sending funds to a deposit address — similar to a bank account — at such an exchange. Law enforcement can subpoena the exchange to learn who controls that address. Check out the example we can find with a bit of digging below. </span></p>\n<p><strong><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5949 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Graph_BTC_EmpiresX_com_victim_plus_depos-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1802\" height=\"548\" srcset=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Graph_BTC_EmpiresX_com_victim_plus_depos-1.png 1802w, https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Graph_BTC_EmpiresX_com_victim_plus_depos-1-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Graph_BTC_EmpiresX_com_victim_plus_depos-1-1024x311.png 1024w, https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Graph_BTC_EmpiresX_com_victim_plus_depos-1-1536x467.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1802px) 100vw, 1802px\" /></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On August 30, 2021, EmpiresX sent over $110,000 worth of Bitcoin to a deposit address at a compliant cryptocurrency exchange (which we’ll leave unnamed in this blog). Armed with this insight from Chainalysis data, a law enforcement agency could subpoena that exchange to learn who controls that deposit address. This would likely be the first step in unmasking the operators of EmpiresX. After that, the investigation would continue to unfold in logical fashion incorporating a host of traditional investigative techniques. Investigators could also use similar blockchain analysis techniques to identify other potential victims of the scam, and see how widespread the fraud is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None of the initial work described above required expert knowledge in cybersecurity or how cryptocurrency works. Of course, not every inquiry will be so straightforward, which is why additional training and knowledge of crypto fundamentals are necessary. But the low hanging fruit is there. Lots of active scams stealing billions from users around the world — potentially in your jurisdiction — can be identified and investigated today using the techniques shown above. Blockchain analysis tools and </span><a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-certification-programs/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">training</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Chainalysis can help you start tracking down those bad actors and potentially </span><a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/cryptoasset-realization-explained/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recover</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> victim funds. That last point is especially important — U.S. law enforcement and tax agencies have seized over $10 billion USD worth of cryptocurrency from criminals since January 2021.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local Law enforcement agencies large and small have the power to investigate crypto crime</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scams aren’t the only form of cryptocurrency-based crime that local law enforcement agencies need to be thinking about. Ransomware attackers frequently target schools, hospitals, and other forms of critical infrastructure across the world. Darknet markets and narco-trafficking groups flood our communities with illegal drugs. These crimes are eroding trust, poisoning our cities, and raising costs of doing business as governments and industry struggle to counter them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The diversity and impact of these threats underline the importance of blockchain analysis training for local and regional law enforcement. Criminals are causing billions of dollars in damage each year right in our own communities. Local and regional agencies can successfully investigate these cases with the right tools, data, and training.</span></p>\n<p><b>About the author:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Gurvais C.

Using Reactor, we can look at where EmpiresX sends the funds it takes in, and thanks to the permanence and transparency of the blockchain, we can do it faster and more comprehensively than we could in a traditional financial investigation. \nThe goal of any crypto scammer is to eventually convert the stolen funds back into fiat currency they can spend, but this can only be done through centralized cryptocurrency exchanges — think common brand names like Coinbase and Kraken — all of whom are subject to anti-money laundering (AML) compliance procedures like Know-Your-Customer (KYC), similar to banks. We can look through EmpiresX’s transaction history in Reactor to find instances of its wallet sending funds to a deposit address — similar to a bank account — at such an exchange. Law enforcement can subpoena the exchange to learn who controls that address. Check out the example we can find with a bit of digging below. \nOn August 30, 2021, EmpiresX sent over $110,000 worth of Bitcoin to a deposit address at a compliant cryptocurrency exchange (which we’ll leave unnamed in this blog). Armed with this insight from Chainalysis data, a law enforcement agency could subpoena that exchange to learn who controls that deposit address. This would likely be the first step in unmasking the operators of EmpiresX. After that, the investigation would continue to unfold in logical fashion incorporating a host of traditional investigative techniques. Investigators could also use similar blockchain analysis techniques to identify other potential victims of the scam, and see how widespread the fraud is.\nNone of the initial work described above required expert knowledge in cybersecurity or how cryptocurrency works. Of course, not every inquiry will be so straightforward, which is why additional training and knowledge of crypto fundamentals are necessary. But the low hanging fruit is there. Lots of active scams stealing billions from users around the world — potentially in your jurisdiction — can be identified and investigated today using the techniques shown above. Blockchain analysis tools and training from Chainalysis can help you start tracking down those bad actors and potentially recover victim funds. That last point is especially important — U.S. law enforcement and tax agencies have seized over $10 billion USD worth of cryptocurrency from criminals since January 2021.\nLocal Law enforcement agencies large and small have the power to investigate crypto crime\nScams aren’t the only form of cryptocurrency-based crime that local law enforcement agencies need to be thinking about. Ransomware attackers frequently target schools, hospitals, and other forms of critical infrastructure across the world. Darknet markets and narco-trafficking groups flood our communities with illegal drugs. These crimes are eroding trust, poisoning our cities, and raising costs of doing business as governments and industry struggle to counter them. \nThe diversity and impact of these threats underline the importance of blockchain analysis training for local and regional law enforcement. Criminals are causing billions of dollars in damage each year right in our own communities. Local and regional agencies can successfully investigate these cases with the right tools, data, and training.\nAbout the author: Gurvais C.
