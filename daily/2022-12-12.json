Cacti was motivated by the observation that the blockchain/DLT ecosystem is fragmented into several independent networks built on a diverse set of DLTs, many of which are permissioned, but which cannot afford to remain isolated from each other, limiting the scale and utility of their business processes (smart contracts and “dapps”) and trapping their assets in silos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider a trade logistics network (like <a href=\"https://www.tradelens.com\">TradeLens</a>) that maintains bills of lading for shipments on its ledger.

In another scenario that is increasingly common and salient in the DeFi world, financial instruments and currency accounts (e.g., Central Bank DIgital Currency, or CBDC) are maintained on different ledgers.

Instead, Cacti allows networks to preserve autonomy of decision-making while conducting cross-network transactions on a need basis. In effect, Hyperledger Cacti scales decentralized trust above and beyond the confines of a single network without requiring networks to merge or integrate, in effect enabling a network-of-networks, as illustrated in the figure below using samples of DLT networks and cross-chain operations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cSZowCvlr3mIRAO5H6YkUhdQc5lRhGdhKdHD_SNbYXiTpYm4odB7PGzBg4zML85NHlaIWlyJx__tfUG2yEvTHqAYaBPAq9FlhNbtgLl8SdOSvfhm8NEJQ1e4G-HnVuPR2aackQsJ1wSML6zV5th2Fw6kDbRLJ3p2HkjMf9ROAUgXkja8T3Dmeu37O5P53w\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A core design tenet of Hyperledger Cacti is that it does not require modification to any existing DLT stack, and operates purely at the contract- and-application layers (or Layer 2).

Users can customize the level of decentralization they require using a combination of the Node Server inherited from Cactus and a pluggable network-centric relay (or gateway) inherited from Weaver. The figure below illustrates how distributed applications running on distinct ledgers can trigger cross-network transactions either from a centralized Node Server or in a peer-to-peer manner using relays.

Governments around the world are not sitting on the sidelines but jumping mainstream into this disruptive technology to drive citizen-centered governance.\nTo learn more about how Infosys leverages blockchain technologies to build reliable, trusted and sustainable ecosystems for governments and other organizations, go here.\nThe post Process Transformation for Public Services Driven by Blockchain appeared first on Hyperledger Foundation.","dc:creator":"Gopikrishnan Konnanath, Senior Vice President, Global Head – Engineering Services and Blockchain, Infosys, and Srikanth Challa, Senior Director, Blockchain, Infosys","content":"<p>Several government departments around the world are keen to offer their citizens seamless interactions and engaging experiences, akin to those in the private sector.&#160; The public sector is often riddled...</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2022/11/10/process-transformation-for-public-services-driven-by-blockchain\">Process Transformation for Public Services Driven by Blockchain</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hyperledger.org\">Hyperledger Foundation</a>.</p>\n","contentSnippet":"Several government departments around the world are keen to offer their citizens seamless interactions and engaging experiences, akin to those in the private sector.  The public sector is often riddled...\nThe post Process Transformation for Public Services Driven by Blockchain appeared first on Hyperledger Foundation.","guid":"https://www.hyperledger.org/?p=235001","categories":["Blog","Hyperledger Aries","Hyperledger Fabric","Hyperledger Indy","InfoSys","Public sector","Riverside County California","State of Rhode Island"],"isoDate":"2022-11-10T16:00:00.000Z","from":"https://www.hyperledger.org/feed"},{"creator":"Stephen Curran, Maintainer, Hyperledger AnonCreds","title":"Announcing Hyperledger AnonCreds: Open Source, Open Specification Privacy Preserving Verifiable Credentials","link":"https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2022/11/15/announcing-hyperledger-anoncreds-open-source-open-specification-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials","pubDate":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 16:00:00 +0000","content:encoded":"\n<p>AnonCreds, the most commonly used Verifiable Credential (VC) format in the world*, is now a Hyperledger project.

They also have to provide more straightforward user education to help familiarize newcomers with novel features and interactions found on Web3 platforms.</p><p>Making DApps feel secure has to be a high priority too. It’s impossible to control the trustless, permissionless nature of Web3, but designers can predict what may go wrong and help prevent those occurrences. More transparent caveats about risks will go a long way to assuage people’s concerns and convince them to embrace Web3.</p><p>However, to start doing that — designers need to have a good grasp of terms used on a day-to-day basis in Web3.</p><p>Let’s go over the ABCs of Web3.</p><h3>A</h3><p><strong>Address </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>also referred to as wallet address or blockchain address — just like someone has a home and business address, a blockchain has an address to identify its location. A blockchain address is a long alphanumeric reference to access the precise location of the transaction’s home. It also can be where someone receives, sends, or holds their blockchain transactions. An example of a blockchain address is: <em>5TdA55HeLopzzwe3Lg7W335tGdCc623PoQ.</em></p><p><strong>Airdrop </strong><em>(noun, verb)<br></em>a specified amount of cryptocurrency, social tokens, or a new NFT dropped into a holder’s wallet for free or in exchange for minimal promotional work. It is a popular way for startups, NFT projects and social token creators to reward and engage their community.</p><p><strong>Altcoin </strong><em>(noun)</em><br>initially used to refer to any cryptocurrency that wasn’t Bitcoin, altcoin may now refer to any new cryptocurrency with a relatively small market cap.</p><p><strong>Alts </strong><em>(noun)</em><br>short for altcoins.</p><p><strong>ATH- All Time High </strong><em>(noun)</em><br>the highest price an asset has ever had.</p><p><strong>ATL- All Time Low </strong><em>(noun)</em><br>the lowest price an asset has ever had.</p><h3>B</h3><p><strong>Blockchain </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>a distributed database shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. It’s an immutable database, which means that information can’t be tampered with or altered once it’s been recorded. If there’s an error in an entry, then a new, revised entry must be made, and both entries will subsequently be visible on the ledger.</p><p><strong>Bridge in/bridge out </strong><em>(verb)</em><strong><br></strong>a blockchain bridge is a connection that allows the transfer of social tokens from one chain to another. Both chains can have distinct protocols, rules, and governance models, but the bridge provides a compatible way to conduct the transaction securely on both sides. For example, holders of Rally.io tokens can bridge out some (or all) of their holdings in the Rally sidechain to the Ethereum chain. From there, they can sell (or bridge) their Ethereum for currency.</p><p><strong>Burn </strong><em>(verb)</em><strong><br></strong>the process where tokens are removed from circulation. Coin burning is a market tool to increase the value of cryptocurrency.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1-rumDpe_f_lfa2uS8k54Q.png\" /></figure><h3>C</h3><p><strong>Circulating supply </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>the number of cryptocurrency coins or tokens publicly available in the market.</p><p><strong>Composability </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong> the ability of decentralized applications (dApps) and DAOs to effectively clone and integrate one another.</p><h3>D</h3><p><strong>DAO </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong><em>Decentralized Autonomous Organization</em> — a community-led entity with no central authority. Ultimately, a DAO is run exclusively by its individual members, who jointly decide on important project issues including technical advancements and treasury allocations. Smart contracts set the ground rules, carry out the decisions reached by the community, and allow for public auditing at any time, making it completely autonomous and transparent.</p><p><strong>DApps </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>Decentralized Applications — digital applications that run on a blockchain network of computers instead of relying on a single computer. Since DApps are decentralized, they are free from the control and interference of a single authority. Benefits of dApps include the safeguarding of user privacy, the lack of censorship, and the flexibility of development.</p><p><strong>Decentralized exchange — DEX </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>DEX decentralized exchanges are smart contracts tailored for offering peer-to-peer transactions that ensure theoretically complete anonymity. This means the actual asset being exchanged never passes through the hands of an intermediary.</p><p><strong>Decentralized network </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>in computing terms, a decentralized network architecture distributes workloads among several machines instead of relying on a single central server. No one company or company’s servers control the network. Decentralized networks offer a wide range of benefits over centralized networks, including increased system reliability, scale, and privacy.</p><p><strong>Degen </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>now an affectionate and self-assigned term that members of the crypto world refer to themselves and others. Even though it stems from Degenerate or Degenerative Gambler, it is generally used as a badge of honour without negative ideals. Degens can often be found at 4am staring at multiple screens, looking for the next token or NFT drop.</p><h3>E</h3><p><strong>ETH </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>abbreviation for Ethereum cryptocurrency. Ethereum is a blockchain network with a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. Its currency is Ether (ETH).</p><p><strong>Exchange </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>a platform on which to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Users can trade one crypto for another or buy crypto using traditional currency. Exchanges also can convert cryptocurrencies into US dollars or other government-backed currencies to be deposited into a traditional bank account.</p><h3>F</h3><p><strong>Fiat currency </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>the paper/coin currency of the government or region, typically declared as legal tender (eg. USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, etc).</p><p><strong>Floor</strong> <em>(noun)</em><br>the floor or floor price is the lowest price to buy an NFT on the secondary market.</p><p><strong>Fork </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>an update in the network protocol (the open-source software that runs blockchains)</p><h3>G</h3><p><strong>Gas and gas fees </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>transaction fees that users pay to miners on a blockchain protocol to have their transactions included in the block. The system works on a standard supply-and-demand mechanism. If there is a higher demand for transactions, miners may decide to include different levels of transactions, forcing users to pay more for more rapid and effective transaction processing.</p><p><strong>Gwei </strong><em>(noun)</em><strong><br></strong>a term for a very small amount of Ethereum cryptocurrency and commonly used when discussing and paying transactions fees on the Ethereum network. One Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH.</p><h3>H</h3><p><strong>Hodl (or hodling) </strong><em>(verb)</em><strong><br></strong>a hold in the context of buying and holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Hodl is derived from a misspelling of “hold” from a Bitcoin forum post from 2013.</p><h3>I</h3><p><strong>Impermanent loss </strong><em>(noun)<br></em>the loss that occurs when the tokens are in a liquidity pool compared to if they are just held in a crypto wallet is called impermanent loss. This type of loss is considered “impermanent” because it is only realized and becomes “permanent” when you withdraw the deposit. Interestingly enough, impermanent loss happens whichever way the price moves, no matter up or down.

They also have to provide more straightforward user education to help familiarize newcomers with novel features and interactions found on Web3 platforms.\nMaking DApps feel secure has to be a high priority too. It’s impossible to control the trustless, permissionless nature of Web3, but designers can predict what may go wrong and help prevent those occurrences. More transparent caveats about risks will go a long way to assuage people’s concerns and convince them to embrace Web3.\nHowever, to start doing that — designers need to have a good grasp of terms used on a day-to-day basis in Web3.\nLet’s go over the ABCs of Web3.\nA\nAddress (noun)\nalso referred to as wallet address or blockchain address — just like someone has a home and business address, a blockchain has an address to identify its location. A blockchain address is a long alphanumeric reference to access the precise location of the transaction’s home. It also can be where someone receives, sends, or holds their blockchain transactions. An example of a blockchain address is: 5TdA55HeLopzzwe3Lg7W335tGdCc623PoQ.\nAirdrop (noun, verb)\na specified amount of cryptocurrency, social tokens, or a new NFT dropped into a holder’s wallet for free or in exchange for minimal promotional work. It is a popular way for startups, NFT projects and social token creators to reward and engage their community.\nAltcoin (noun)\ninitially used to refer to any cryptocurrency that wasn’t Bitcoin, altcoin may now refer to any new cryptocurrency with a relatively small market cap.\nAlts (noun)\nshort for altcoins.\nATH- All Time High (noun)\nthe highest price an asset has ever had.\nATL- All Time Low (noun)\nthe lowest price an asset has ever had.\nB\nBlockchain (noun)\na distributed database shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. It’s an immutable database, which means that information can’t be tampered with or altered once it’s been recorded. If there’s an error in an entry, then a new, revised entry must be made, and both entries will subsequently be visible on the ledger.\nBridge in/bridge out (verb)\na blockchain bridge is a connection that allows the transfer of social tokens from one chain to another. Both chains can have distinct protocols, rules, and governance models, but the bridge provides a compatible way to conduct the transaction securely on both sides. For example, holders of Rally.io tokens can bridge out some (or all) of their holdings in the Rally sidechain to the Ethereum chain. From there, they can sell (or bridge) their Ethereum for currency.\nBurn (verb)\nthe process where tokens are removed from circulation. Coin burning is a market tool to increase the value of cryptocurrency.\n\nC\nCirculating supply (noun)\nthe number of cryptocurrency coins or tokens publicly available in the market.\nComposability (noun)\n the ability of decentralized applications (dApps) and DAOs to effectively clone and integrate one another.\nD\nDAO (noun)\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization — a community-led entity with no central authority. Ultimately, a DAO is run exclusively by its individual members, who jointly decide on important project issues including technical advancements and treasury allocations. Smart contracts set the ground rules, carry out the decisions reached by the community, and allow for public auditing at any time, making it completely autonomous and transparent.\nDApps (noun)\nDecentralized Applications — digital applications that run on a blockchain network of computers instead of relying on a single computer. Since DApps are decentralized, they are free from the control and interference of a single authority. Benefits of dApps include the safeguarding of user privacy, the lack of censorship, and the flexibility of development.\nDecentralized exchange — DEX (noun)\nDEX decentralized exchanges are smart contracts tailored for offering peer-to-peer transactions that ensure theoretically complete anonymity. This means the actual asset being exchanged never passes through the hands of an intermediary.\nDecentralized network (noun)\nin computing terms, a decentralized network architecture distributes workloads among several machines instead of relying on a single central server. No one company or company’s servers control the network. Decentralized networks offer a wide range of benefits over centralized networks, including increased system reliability, scale, and privacy.\nDegen (noun)\nnow an affectionate and self-assigned term that members of the crypto world refer to themselves and others. Even though it stems from Degenerate or Degenerative Gambler, it is generally used as a badge of honour without negative ideals. Degens can often be found at 4am staring at multiple screens, looking for the next token or NFT drop.\nE\nETH (noun)\nabbreviation for Ethereum cryptocurrency. Ethereum is a blockchain network with a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. Its currency is Ether (ETH).\nExchange (noun)\na platform on which to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Users can trade one crypto for another or buy crypto using traditional currency. Exchanges also can convert cryptocurrencies into US dollars or other government-backed currencies to be deposited into a traditional bank account.\nF\nFiat currency (noun)\nthe paper/coin currency of the government or region, typically declared as legal tender (eg. USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, etc).\nFloor (noun)\nthe floor or floor price is the lowest price to buy an NFT on the secondary market.\nFork (noun)\nan update in the network protocol (the open-source software that runs blockchains)\nG\nGas and gas fees (noun)\ntransaction fees that users pay to miners on a blockchain protocol to have their transactions included in the block. The system works on a standard supply-and-demand mechanism. If there is a higher demand for transactions, miners may decide to include different levels of transactions, forcing users to pay more for more rapid and effective transaction processing.\nGwei (noun)\na term for a very small amount of Ethereum cryptocurrency and commonly used when discussing and paying transactions fees on the Ethereum network. One Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH.\nH\nHodl (or hodling) (verb)\na hold in the context of buying and holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Hodl is derived from a misspelling of “hold” from a Bitcoin forum post from 2013.\nI\nImpermanent loss (noun)\nthe loss that occurs when the tokens are in a liquidity pool compared to if they are just held in a crypto wallet is called impermanent loss. This type of loss is considered “impermanent” because it is only realized and becomes “permanent” when you withdraw the deposit. Interestingly enough, impermanent loss happens whichever way the price moves, no matter up or down. The bigger the change in price, the bigger the impermanent loss.\nK\nKYC (noun)\n“know your customer “— the process of verifying a customer’s identity. Most commonly used by financial institutions and financial service businesses, including banks, stockbrokers, and cryptocurrency exchanges.\nL\nLiquidity Pool (noun)\na platform where a pool of cryptocurrencies or tokens are crowdsourced and locked in a smart contract. And while being locked, they are being used as sources for loans for exchanges, and other applications.\n\nM\nMainnet (noun)\na blockchain that transfers a digital currency from a sender to a recipient. Mainnet is the main network; actual transactions take place on a distributed ledger.\nMetaverse (noun)\nthe metaverse is an expansive network of persistent, real-time rendered 3D worlds and simulations that support continuity of identity, objects, history, payments, and entitlements; can be experienced synchronously by an unlimited number of users, each with an individual sense of presence. More simply, a set of virtual spaces where people can create and explore with other people who aren’t in the same physical space. Decentraland and The Sandbox are two of the most popular metaverse platforms.\nMining/miners (verb)\nthe process of adding transactions to a large distributed public ledger of existing transactions known as a blockchain. Mining involves creating a hash of a block (a digital fingerprint) of transactions that cannot be easily forged, protecting the integrity of the entire blockchain without the need for a central system.

The digital item or file is stored forever in this decentralized database or distributed ledger, and it is impossible to edit, modify, or delete. During the minting process, the creator of the NFT can schedule royalties from every subsequent sale.\nN\nNFA (noun)\nNot Financial Advice — a warning of the inherent risks to potential investors of cryptocurrency and NFT projects.\nNFT\nNon-Fungible Tokens — cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. NFTs can also be used to represent real-world items like artwork and real estate.\nNode — a computer connected to a cryptocurrency network; can execute functions like creating, receiving, or sending information.\nP\nP2P (noun)\npeer-to-peer, a decentralized platform where two individuals interact without intermediation by a third party. The buyer and the seller transact directly with each other via the P2P service. The P2P platform may provide services such as search, screening, rating, payment processing, or escrow.\nPFP (noun)\nprofile picture — usually refers to a profile picture as an NFT.\nPlay to earn (noun)\na business model for the video game industry that allows players to earn digital assets they can sell for money in a marketplace.

I didn’t want any of this to happen. I certainly wasn’t nearly as competent as I thought I was,” Bankman-Fried said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The disgraced former crypto billionaire noted he didn’t think he’ll be arrested for fraud but did worry about it. He conceded doing the wrong things while running FTX, albeit unintentionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bankman-Fried said: “It [FTX’s collapse] hurt a lot of people, and that’s on me one way or another. But I didn’t think it was going to happen. I never wanted anything like this to happen.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I was surprised when it did. I’m not lying, and I think all that I have left now is to tell my truth and let the cards fall as they may.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FTX, alongside more than 100 affiliated entities, filed for bankruptcy last month after failing under the pressure of a $6 billion bank run. Customers rushed to withdraw funds after insolvency rumors swirled alongside revelations of funneling user funds to sister trading venture Alameda Research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63911363\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told the BBC’s</a> Joe Tidy that he ran some aspects of FTX well — although he didn’t elaborate on which parts — “but some wasn’t enough.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Tidy asked Bankman-Fried if he thought himself a good businessman, Bankman-Fried replied: “Yep,” but added that he grew careless over the past year. “Part of me was aware of that fact and didn’t know what to do about it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sam Bankman-Fried doesn’t rule out potential crypto comeback</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the US Congress — alongside up to a million FTX users around the world — waits to hear potential testimony from Bankman-Fried on Tuesday, the FTX founder says his own financial outlook seems bleak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The math isn’t looking great on a six-month long time scale. I don’t know, legal fees can get quite expensive,” Bankman-Fried said. He’d previously claimed access to just $100,000 and one functional credit card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;“I’m not hiding any assets here, anything I’ve had, I’ve disclosed to and I don’t even have access to my own personal data, I’m trying to get a login for my own bank account.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for whether Bankman-Fried plans to ever make a comeback in crypto, he said he wasn’t sure — but if he were to be involved in another company, he would want it to have a “really high standard of transparency.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How realistic a potential future Bankman-Fried venture would be, or what it would look like, wasn’t addressed. Bankman-Fried said he “would give anything to be able to [pay users back] and I’m gonna try if I can.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the FTX saga looks set to stretch across multiple years, especially if previous crypto exchange insolvencies (such as Mt.

I didn’t want any of this to happen. I certainly wasn’t nearly as competent as I thought I was,” Bankman-Fried said.\nThe disgraced former crypto billionaire noted he didn’t think he’ll be arrested for fraud but did worry about it. He conceded doing the wrong things while running FTX, albeit unintentionally.\nBankman-Fried said: “It [FTX’s collapse] hurt a lot of people, and that’s on me one way or another. But I didn’t think it was going to happen. I never wanted anything like this to happen.” \n“I was surprised when it did. I’m not lying, and I think all that I have left now is to tell my truth and let the cards fall as they may.”\nFTX, alongside more than 100 affiliated entities, filed for bankruptcy last month after failing under the pressure of a $6 billion bank run. Customers rushed to withdraw funds after insolvency rumors swirled alongside revelations of funneling user funds to sister trading venture Alameda Research.\nBankman-Fried told the BBC’s Joe Tidy that he ran some aspects of FTX well — although he didn’t elaborate on which parts — “but some wasn’t enough.”\nWhen Tidy asked Bankman-Fried if he thought himself a good businessman, Bankman-Fried replied: “Yep,” but added that he grew careless over the past year. “Part of me was aware of that fact and didn’t know what to do about it.”\nSam Bankman-Fried doesn’t rule out potential crypto comeback\nWhile the US Congress — alongside up to a million FTX users around the world — waits to hear potential testimony from Bankman-Fried on Tuesday, the FTX founder says his own financial outlook seems bleak.\n“The math isn’t looking great on a six-month long time scale. I don’t know, legal fees can get quite expensive,” Bankman-Fried said. He’d previously claimed access to just $100,000 and one functional credit card.\n “I’m not hiding any assets here, anything I’ve had, I’ve disclosed to and I don’t even have access to my own personal data, I’m trying to get a login for my own bank account.”\nAs for whether Bankman-Fried plans to ever make a comeback in crypto, he said he wasn’t sure — but if he were to be involved in another company, he would want it to have a “really high standard of transparency.”\nHow realistic a potential future Bankman-Fried venture would be, or what it would look like, wasn’t addressed. Bankman-Fried said he “would give anything to be able to [pay users back] and I’m gonna try if I can.”\nIndeed, the FTX saga looks set to stretch across multiple years, especially if previous crypto exchange insolvencies (such as Mt. Gox) are anything to go by. \nStill, Bankman-Fried shared the belief that he hadn’t single-handedly killed crypto: “I hope not. I don’t think so. I think it’s more resilient than that.”\n“And if I killed crypto, then crypto is not what we thought it was, because crypto is meant to be resilient.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nCan’t wait?

Whilst the main numbers to look for are US CPI and the FOMC rate decision, we also have EU and UK central bank meetings that add extra uncertainty.</p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Data from the beginning of November showed signs of inflation beginning to slow, with CPI and PPI both undershooting expectations and causing a risk on rally as the markets began to price in a FED pivot (from being solely focused on fighting inflation to taking some consideration for the lag effect of their restrictive policy and not wanting to unnecessarily hurt the economy).</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> More recently however, we have seen data that suggests the pivot idea might not be so clear cut. December numbers showed average hourly earnings strongly overshooting expectations. What is perhaps slightly less appreciated is that revisions of previous earnings data (see graph) provide even more evidence to suggest that the labor market is tighter than initially believed. Note PPI also overshot expectations last Friday (YOY at 7.4% vs an expected 7.2%).</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20080 alignnone\" src=\"https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1654\" height=\"1158\" srcset=\"https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe-200x140.jpg 200w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe-300x210.jpg 300w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe-400x280.jpg 400w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe-600x420.jpg 600w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe-768x538.jpg 768w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe-800x560.jpg 800w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe-1024x717.jpg 1024w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe-1200x840.jpg 1200w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe-1536x1075.jpg 1536w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4w8ye9fshdwe.jpg 1654w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1654px) 100vw, 1654px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> The most recent messaging by Powell has been that whilst a slowdown in large rate hikes is to be expected, inflation risks are nowhere near over. The FED may indeed raise the terminal rate to levels higher than initial projections/market pricing and keep them there for a longer period of time.</p>\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Despite all this, risk assets have showed little sign of reversing the recent rally. The S&amp;P 500 is 10% higher than its local lows in October, US 10Y yields have come down from highs of 4.2% to nearer 3.5%, and ETH is 16% higher than its post FTX implosion lows.</p>\n<p><strong>5)</strong> The FOMC meeting this week comes with an updated Summary of Economic Projections. This provides clarity on the FED&#8217;s current thinking, giving the market an opportunity to reprice its view, but then bringing a greater sense of medium term certainty in the outlook ahead.</p>\n<h2>Potential trades</h2>\n<p><strong>A)</strong> Sell BTC June Calls and hedge with December options.</p>\n<p>Based on (2), (3) and (4), there is reason to believe that a high CPI print on Tuesday could be a tipping point, giving risk assets a strong reason to move back towards the downside and thus generating delta P&amp;L through call selling. A low CPI should reassert the market&#8217;s confidence in inflation coming down, causing a rally in risk assets but bringing vols down again (generating vega P&amp;L through call selling) as this narrative is already somewhat priced in.</p>\n<p>From a volatility surface perspective, BTC June is 4 vols higher than BTC March. This makes it one of the most attractive points to sell, even when ignoring the macro factors in playBackend crypto vol levels have remained high recently, despite shorter dated vols dropping on low realized vol levels. We are entering the festive period with expectation of low realized as people take holidays, thus if spot continues to remain range bound, the backend of the term structure may finally give way. The medium term macro clarity provided by (5) adds even more weight to this argument, as well as the fact that vols typically come back down after CPI/FOMC events.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20086 alignnone\" src=\"https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29thc8ywefs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1396\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29thc8ywefs-200x159.jpg 200w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29thc8ywefs-300x238.jpg 300w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29thc8ywefs-400x317.jpg 400w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29thc8ywefs-600x476.jpg 600w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29thc8ywefs-768x610.jpg 768w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29thc8ywefs-800x635.jpg 800w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29thc8ywefs-1024x813.jpg 1024w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29thc8ywefs-1200x952.jpg 1200w, https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29thc8ywefs.jpg 1396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1396px) 100vw, 1396px\" /></p>\n<p>One can hedge this trade by buying some gamma (short dated options expiring in December).

here.\n\n\n\nDecember 12\nWhat we are seeing in the markets\nThis week brings a round of data releases which have market moving potential. Whilst the main numbers to look for are US CPI and the FOMC rate decision, we also have EU and UK central bank meetings that add extra uncertainty.\n1) Data from the beginning of November showed signs of inflation beginning to slow, with CPI and PPI both undershooting expectations and causing a risk on rally as the markets began to price in a FED pivot (from being solely focused on fighting inflation to taking some consideration for the lag effect of their restrictive policy and not wanting to unnecessarily hurt the economy).\n2) More recently however, we have seen data that suggests the pivot idea might not be so clear cut. December numbers showed average hourly earnings strongly overshooting expectations. What is perhaps slightly less appreciated is that revisions of previous earnings data (see graph) provide even more evidence to suggest that the labor market is tighter than initially believed. Note PPI also overshot expectations last Friday (YOY at 7.4% vs an expected 7.2%).\n\n3) The most recent messaging by Powell has been that whilst a slowdown in large rate hikes is to be expected, inflation risks are nowhere near over. The FED may indeed raise the terminal rate to levels higher than initial projections/market pricing and keep them there for a longer period of time.\n4) Despite all this, risk assets have showed little sign of reversing the recent rally. The S&P 500 is 10% higher than its local lows in October, US 10Y yields have come down from highs of 4.2% to nearer 3.5%, and ETH is 16% higher than its post FTX implosion lows.\n5) The FOMC meeting this week comes with an updated Summary of Economic Projections. This provides clarity on the FED’s current thinking, giving the market an opportunity to reprice its view, but then bringing a greater sense of medium term certainty in the outlook ahead.\nPotential trades\nA) Sell BTC June Calls and hedge with December options.\nBased on (2), (3) and (4), there is reason to believe that a high CPI print on Tuesday could be a tipping point, giving risk assets a strong reason to move back towards the downside and thus generating delta P&L through call selling. A low CPI should reassert the market’s confidence in inflation coming down, causing a rally in risk assets but bringing vols down again (generating vega P&L through call selling) as this narrative is already somewhat priced in.\nFrom a volatility surface perspective, BTC June is 4 vols higher than BTC March. This makes it one of the most attractive points to sell, even when ignoring the macro factors in playBackend crypto vol levels have remained high recently, despite shorter dated vols dropping on low realized vol levels. We are entering the festive period with expectation of low realized as people take holidays, thus if spot continues to remain range bound, the backend of the term structure may finally give way. The medium term macro clarity provided by (5) adds even more weight to this argument, as well as the fact that vols typically come back down after CPI/FOMC events.\n\nOne can hedge this trade by buying some gamma (short dated options expiring in December). The low levels of realized vol have made the weekly straddle prices reasonably cheap compared to historical levels during ‘data week’. This Friday’s BTC and ETH straddles are priced at 0.0453 and 0.0642 respectively, implying approximate moves of 4.5% and 6.4%.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThe information (“Information”) provided by Cumberland DRW LLC and its affiliated or related companies (collectively, “Cumberland”), either in this document or otherwise, is for informational purposes only and is provided without charge.

Programmers use software frameworks for quick application design. \nToolkits may have compilers, code libraries, and APIs to create software.\nIn this article, we look at solutions for embedded systems running on Linux/Unix, Windows, and Android.\nThe Qt Framework\n\nQt logo image \nThe Qt framework is great for creating cross-platform applications for embedded systems. Embedded applications are most often written in C/C++.\nQt supports various platforms:\n\nmobile (Android, iOS);\n\ndesktop (Windows, Linux, macOS);\n\nembedded (Embedded Linux, Embedded Android, Windows Embedded, QNX, etc.). \n\nC++ is an object-oriented programming language (OOP). OOP makes the process of application engineering faster, easier, and safer.\nC++ supports the WOCA (Write Once, Compile Anywhere) principle.\nLicense\nQt can be used under commercial and open-source licenses. You can use Qt under an open-source license for projects with an open-source distribution or without ‌an ‌external distribution.\nQt Instruments\nUseful modules make this toolkit one of the most convenient for cross-platform application engineering. \nQt Creator is an IDE that eases GUI application design or modification. Qt Creator is applied to building software in C++, QML, and JavaScript.\n\nThe Qt Creator screenshot\nQt Creator has a very efficient GUI constructor called Qt Designer. Qt Designer is characterized by support for the visual editing of signals and slots. It can also be used as an independent tool.\nQt Design Studio is a stripped-down version of Qt Creator. It offers a set of 2D/3D instruments for building user interfaces, user experiences, and human-machine interfaces. \nThe Qt framework offers the QML language for UI application design. \nQt Automotive Suite modules and instruments are in charge of creating in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. \nThe Automotive Suite has the Qt Application Manager in its structure, with a high-level API for easy development of a UI system. \nThe Qt GENIVI Extras module allows designers to combine the product with the structure of the GENIVI automotive platform. The Neptune 3 UI helps build the UI for Qt in automotive infotainment (IVI) systems.\nThe Qt Interface Framework module contains the tools you need to develop middleware components (APIs, backends, services).\nThe Qt Safe Renderer module, with its UI rendering element, allows developers to achieve the separation of important interpretations from the rest of the system. In the event of failures or emergencies, this makes it possible to display the most crucial elements of the system.\nOther Multi-Platform Frameworks\nA lot of solutions can solve the same tasks as Qt. When choosing between frameworks, the developer takes into account his experience and the needs of the project.\nWe'll take a look at Qt-like solutions and highlight the features of each framework.\n\nCross-platform toolkits are used for embedded software development.\n.NET, or dotNet, is a Microsoft-owned development platform.\r\nKey features of the platform:\r\n\nopen-source;\r\ncompatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS;\r\nC #, F #, or Visual Basic are supported.\r\nVisual Studio IDE;\r\nIt has a large community.\r\n\nThis structure has a wide variety of compilers, libraries, and APIs to develop and compile mobile and game applications easily.\r\nXamarin is an element of the .Net platform, but it can be used independently.

They can exit their staked position anytime with the simplicity of a token swap.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd despite the presence of custodial staking services (like Coinbase, for example), the recent events in the industry have propelled non-custodial ETH staking protocols (like SafeStake) to become a major force.</p>\n<h2 id=\"custodialvsnoncustodialethstaking\">Custodial vs Non-Custodial ETH Staking</h2>\n<p>ETH 2.0 staking is a great choice for anyone looking to turn their ETH assets into a passive income stream. As an Eth2 validator, you'll be rewarded with fractions of ETH every ~7 minutes for helping secure the network. These rewards can add up and lead to substantial profits over time!</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the most basic terms, the better a validator performs, the higher the staking yields.</p>\n<p>\\\nTherefore, when selecting a staking provider, it’s important to consider a number of factors in your decision such as shared rewards, fees, attestation and effectiveness rates, slashing protection and remediation measures, and perhaps most crucial, user private key management.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs ETH becomes increasingly popular, the importance of security for users and investors on all scales cannot be overstated. Protecting these valuable assets is now a priority like never before.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen considering a third-party staking service, we recommend researching their level of security and examining their key management policy. These are the factors that ultimately determine the safety of your crypto coins.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Types of Third-Party Staking Services</strong></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Custodial:</strong> A centralized staking service that manages the entire ETH staking process on behalf of the user. They retain ‘custody’ of their users' private validator keys and withdrawal keys. Risks: severe slashing penalties, reduced overall rewards, increased likelihood of an attack on user keys.</li>\n<li><strong>Semi-Custodial:</strong> Some staking services claim to be non-custodial but still retain custody of user validator keys, but not their withdrawal keys. Risks: severe slashing penalties and reduced overall rewards.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-Custodial:</strong> A staking service that provides streamlined Eth2 validator setup and management, but allows its users to retain both their private validator keys and withdrawal keys.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nStaking your assets with a custodial service can be risky, as trusting them to keep your private keys exposes you to potential threats. Make sure that the staking provider you select is the right fit for you.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn addition, in centralized custodial services, the risks of a cut-off are even greater, so that their rewards can be severely affected and therefore their capital staked.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile DIY solutions may incur individual consequences for mistakes, escrow and semi-custodial services can deliver a more significant negative impact on the entire user base if they make errors.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/C7LGfLlZs3OY2w0N7r4ePehwKBI2-wv93tau.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>ETH 2.0 staking services can be especially vulnerable to security risks if they are centralized. This year, these risks have been highlighted as DeFi protocols experienced devastating losses due to hackers exploiting singular points of vulnerability and stealing users' funds intended for passive income generation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"noncustodialstakingservicesforeth20staking\">Non-Custodial Staking Services (for ETH 2.0 Staking)</h2>\n<p>Custodial and semi-custodial ETH 2.0 Staking options like Rocket Pool, Lido, Stake Fish, and those offered by CEXs (centralized exchanges) are capturing a large share of the market. However, their centralized nature creates an obstacle to true decentralization in this emerging industry.</p>\n<p>\\\nSolutions are now available that ensure the security and reliability of user funds without granting control to any third parties, while promoting decentralization at the same time. Let's explore some groundbreaking developments we are making in this space!</p>\n<h2 id=\"safestake\">SafeStake</h2>\n<p>SafeStake is a decentralized staking infrastructure and protocol that maximizes staker rewards by implementing DVT (Distributed Validator Technology).</p>\n<p>\\\nWith its unique non-custodial approach and commitment to security, this protocol is emerging as a groundbreaking solution in the ETH staking industry. It provides unparalleled levels of protection for users running validators by never taking control of their keys.</p>\n<p>\\\nInstead, SafeStake splits a validator key into shares and distributes them over several nodes run by independent operators to achieve high levels of security and fault tolerance.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe cutting-edge protocol's frameworks&nbsp;are written in Rust, a top programming language in the industry, and maintain optimal performance in the face of transactional demand by preventing memory-related bugs and vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>\\\nCoupled with the use of HotStuff for underlying consensus, the protocol keeps validators secure and online to perform Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake consensus tasks while minimizing the likelihood of validator cutoff.</p>\n<p>\\\nSafeStake provides a powerful solution for ETH holders, allowing them to maximize rewards while keeping their funds secure. By reducing periods of inactivity and providing protection from malicious withdrawals, SafeStake safeguards your potential profits in the ETH2 staking ecosystem.</p>\n<p>\\\nAdditionally, SafeStake utilizes a threshold signature scheme <strong>without</strong> a trusted dealer. By eliminating the trusted dealer, SafeStake removes another potential point of failure present in some other staking protocols.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis effectively eliminates the possibility that a validator’s rewards can be stolen.</p>\n<p>\\\nBecause Ethereum’s Beacon Chain allows multiple deposits for a single validator public key, it does not verify that they all have the same withdrawal credentials.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis can allow a malicious actor that has access to the validator’s private key to specify the withdrawal credentials for the validator and steal its rewards.</p>\n<p>\\\nJoin the <strong><a href=\"https://parastate.io/safestake\">SafeStake Galileo testnet</a></strong> as a validator or operator to help us test while earning STATE tokens and entering to win ETH prizes!</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/C7LGfLlZs3OY2w0N7r4ePehwKBI2-eta3txk.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>With Distributed Key Generation (DKG), SafeStake arranges the threshold signature scheme validation private key in a way that prevents any single entity from holding it or recreating it.</p>\n<p>\\\nCurrently, the protocol (running on Stage 1 of our testnet dubbed ‘Galileo’) allows any user to participate in Ethereum 2.0 staking by depositing 32 ETH and choosing a group of four operators (an Operator Committee) to manage their validator.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the relatively near future (Q2 2023), we will introduce Stage 2 of the Galileo testnet that will drop the 32 ETH deposit requirement down to 8 ETH, enabling a lower threshold to kick off a Validator on the Beacon chain and the&nbsp;'Pooled Validators’ with derivative tokens.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/C7LGfLlZs3OY2w0N7r4ePehwKBI2-pcb3t5z.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>An optional feature will allow users to receive sfETH liquid staking tokens in return. These tokens are fully liquid with all of the implied benefits, allowing users to trade or sell them whenever they want while generating passive income while they do hold them.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn addition, DVT technology bolsters the entire Ethereum Proof-of-Stake network by providing an extra layer of decentralization and security to ensure reliable transactions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bloxstaking\"><strong>Blox Staking</strong></h2>\n<p>Blox Staking is an open-source, non-custodial staking platform for Ethereum 2.0.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/C7LGfLlZs3OY2w0N7r4ePehwKBI2-zwc3tt7.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Staking with Blox doesn’t require key sharing. Blox has no control over their users’ private keys as the protocol never stores validator private or withdrawal keys, ensuring no compromises on custody.</p>\n<p>\\\nInstead, a dedicated remote signer is stored on a cloud account, like AWS. The remote signer, KeyVault, holds the private validator key and executes duties sent from the blockchain via a Blox node.</p>\n<p>\\\nUsers can manage their validators and check a performance monitoring dashboard with the Blox Live desktop app.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Blox infrastructure ensures relatively consistent connectivity to the blockchain and manages signing requests for each user’s personal KeyVault instance. This configuration empowers validators to optimize staking returns, minimize risks, and keep complete control over their assets.</p>\n<p>\\\nOne of the major limitations of the protocol is that it only supports a 32 ETH deposit to participate in ETH 2.0 staking.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/C7LGfLlZs3OY2w0N7r4ePehwKBI2-mqd3tp6.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"oboltech\">Obol Tech</h2>\n<p>Obol is a trust-minimized staking protocol for public blockchain networks based on Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). DVT enables validators to configure clusters with active-active redundancy, an improvement on the widely used configuration of active-passive redundancy.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is achieved by being able to split a validator key across multiple independently operating instances and utilizing threshold signing to perform consensus duties. You can think of this as enabling your validator to operate like a multi-sig, removing single points of technical failure including:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Availability Failure</li>\n<li>Validator Key Compromise</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nDistributed Validator nodes operate together as ‘clusters’ through the inclusion of a distributed validator middleware client called Charon. Charon's job is to coordinate what each validator signs, and reconstitutes the partial signatures into an aggregate signature for the Distributed Validator.</p>\n<p>\\\nDistributed Validator Clusters are multi-operator, fault-tolerant clusters of servers running Ethereum Execution clients, Consensus clients, Distributed Validator clients, and Validator clients.</p>\n<p>\\\nCombined, they enable a subset of servers to fail and recover, without a Distributed Validator on the cluster going offline.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/C7LGfLlZs3OY2w0N7r4ePehwKBI2-18e3tzn.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Obol’s mission is to evolve DVT by offering a protocol that enables a sustainable public good by increasing the security and resilience of public blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe network is designed to offer developers, institutions and individuals, including, custodians, DeFi protocols, DAOs, financial institutions, and home-based validators, a scalable layer to configure, monitor, and deploy their own multi-carrier participation clusters without the need to coordinate multiple carriers or manage complex infrastructure configurations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Ethereum 2.0 staking services offer a variety of different approaches depending on how their developers have integrated users into the product experience when building out ideas and offering support.</p>\n<p>\\\nSecurity is key when navigating today's billion-dollar ETH staking industry and its plethora of staking options. Cryptocurrency provides plenty of opportunities for financial freedom but also comes with its own unique set of risks.</p>\n<p>\\\nWithout taking the necessary precautions to protect your assets, it's easy to get left behind in this volatile market.

Make sure that the staking provider you select is the right fit for you.\n\\\nIn addition, in centralized custodial services, the risks of a cut-off are even greater, so that their rewards can be severely affected and therefore their capital staked.\n\\\nWhile DIY solutions may incur individual consequences for mistakes, escrow and semi-custodial services can deliver a more significant negative impact on the entire user base if they make errors.\n\\\n \nETH 2.0 staking services can be especially vulnerable to security risks if they are centralized. This year, these risks have been highlighted as DeFi protocols experienced devastating losses due to hackers exploiting singular points of vulnerability and stealing users' funds intended for passive income generation.\nNon-Custodial Staking Services (for ETH 2.0 Staking)\nCustodial and semi-custodial ETH 2.0 Staking options like Rocket Pool, Lido, Stake Fish, and those offered by CEXs (centralized exchanges) are capturing a large share of the market. However, their centralized nature creates an obstacle to true decentralization in this emerging industry.\n\\\nSolutions are now available that ensure the security and reliability of user funds without granting control to any third parties, while promoting decentralization at the same time. Let's explore some groundbreaking developments we are making in this space!\nSafeStake\nSafeStake is a decentralized staking infrastructure and protocol that maximizes staker rewards by implementing DVT (Distributed Validator Technology).\n\\\nWith its unique non-custodial approach and commitment to security, this protocol is emerging as a groundbreaking solution in the ETH staking industry. It provides unparalleled levels of protection for users running validators by never taking control of their keys.\n\\\nInstead, SafeStake splits a validator key into shares and distributes them over several nodes run by independent operators to achieve high levels of security and fault tolerance.\n\\\nThe cutting-edge protocol's frameworks are written in Rust, a top programming language in the industry, and maintain optimal performance in the face of transactional demand by preventing memory-related bugs and vulnerabilities.\n\\\nCoupled with the use of HotStuff for underlying consensus, the protocol keeps validators secure and online to perform Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake consensus tasks while minimizing the likelihood of validator cutoff.\n\\\nSafeStake provides a powerful solution for ETH holders, allowing them to maximize rewards while keeping their funds secure. By reducing periods of inactivity and providing protection from malicious withdrawals, SafeStake safeguards your potential profits in the ETH2 staking ecosystem.\n\\\nAdditionally, SafeStake utilizes a threshold signature scheme without a trusted dealer. By eliminating the trusted dealer, SafeStake removes another potential point of failure present in some other staking protocols.\n\\\nThis effectively eliminates the possibility that a validator’s rewards can be stolen.\n\\\nBecause Ethereum’s Beacon Chain allows multiple deposits for a single validator public key, it does not verify that they all have the same withdrawal credentials.\n\\\nThis can allow a malicious actor that has access to the validator’s private key to specify the withdrawal credentials for the validator and steal its rewards.\n\\\nJoin the SafeStake Galileo testnet as a validator or operator to help us test while earning STATE tokens and entering to win ETH prizes!\n\\\n \nWith Distributed Key Generation (DKG), SafeStake arranges the threshold signature scheme validation private key in a way that prevents any single entity from holding it or recreating it.\n\\\nCurrently, the protocol (running on Stage 1 of our testnet dubbed ‘Galileo’) allows any user to participate in Ethereum 2.0 staking by depositing 32 ETH and choosing a group of four operators (an Operator Committee) to manage their validator.\n\\\nIn the relatively near future (Q2 2023), we will introduce Stage 2 of the Galileo testnet that will drop the 32 ETH deposit requirement down to 8 ETH, enabling a lower threshold to kick off a Validator on the Beacon chain and the 'Pooled Validators’ with derivative tokens.\n\\\n \nAn optional feature will allow users to receive sfETH liquid staking tokens in return. These tokens are fully liquid with all of the implied benefits, allowing users to trade or sell them whenever they want while generating passive income while they do hold them.\n\\\nIn addition, DVT technology bolsters the entire Ethereum Proof-of-Stake network by providing an extra layer of decentralization and security to ensure reliable transactions.\nBlox Staking\nBlox Staking is an open-source, non-custodial staking platform for Ethereum 2.0.\n\\\n \nStaking with Blox doesn’t require key sharing. Blox has no control over their users’ private keys as the protocol never stores validator private or withdrawal keys, ensuring no compromises on custody.\n\\\nInstead, a dedicated remote signer is stored on a cloud account, like AWS. The remote signer, KeyVault, holds the private validator key and executes duties sent from the blockchain via a Blox node.\n\\\nUsers can manage their validators and check a performance monitoring dashboard with the Blox Live desktop app.\n\\\nThe Blox infrastructure ensures relatively consistent connectivity to the blockchain and manages signing requests for each user’s personal KeyVault instance. This configuration empowers validators to optimize staking returns, minimize risks, and keep complete control over their assets.\n\\\nOne of the major limitations of the protocol is that it only supports a 32 ETH deposit to participate in ETH 2.0 staking.\n\nObol Tech\nObol is a trust-minimized staking protocol for public blockchain networks based on Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). DVT enables validators to configure clusters with active-active redundancy, an improvement on the widely used configuration of active-passive redundancy.\n\\\nThis is achieved by being able to split a validator key across multiple independently operating instances and utilizing threshold signing to perform consensus duties. You can think of this as enabling your validator to operate like a multi-sig, removing single points of technical failure including:\n\\\n\nAvailability Failure\nValidator Key Compromise\n\\\nDistributed Validator nodes operate together as ‘clusters’ through the inclusion of a distributed validator middleware client called Charon. Charon's job is to coordinate what each validator signs, and reconstitutes the partial signatures into an aggregate signature for the Distributed Validator.\n\\\nDistributed Validator Clusters are multi-operator, fault-tolerant clusters of servers running Ethereum Execution clients, Consensus clients, Distributed Validator clients, and Validator clients.\n\\\nCombined, they enable a subset of servers to fail and recover, without a Distributed Validator on the cluster going offline.\n\nObol’s mission is to evolve DVT by offering a protocol that enables a sustainable public good by increasing the security and resilience of public blockchain networks.\n\\\nThe network is designed to offer developers, institutions and individuals, including, custodians, DeFi protocols, DAOs, financial institutions, and home-based validators, a scalable layer to configure, monitor, and deploy their own multi-carrier participation clusters without the need to coordinate multiple carriers or manage complex infrastructure configurations.\nConclusion\nEthereum 2.0 staking services offer a variety of different approaches depending on how their developers have integrated users into the product experience when building out ideas and offering support.\n\\\nSecurity is key when navigating today's billion-dollar ETH staking industry and its plethora of staking options. Cryptocurrency provides plenty of opportunities for financial freedom but also comes with its own unique set of risks.\n\\\nWithout taking the necessary precautions to protect your assets, it's easy to get left behind in this volatile market. Safeguard yourself by ensuring nobody else has access to those precious private keys!","dc:creator":"Daniel Jimenez","content":"ETH 2.0 is spearheading a rapidly expanding industry estimated to be worth $40 billion in 2025.

Variables should help readers understand code quickly and not slow them down forcing them to read unnecessary text.\n\\\n   Here are examples of necessary naming:\n   const PHONE_NUMBER_REGEX = /^[\\+]?[(]?[0-9]{3}[)]?[-\\s\\.]?[0-9]{3}[-\\s\\.]?[0-9]{4,6}$/\n   const str.match(phoneNumberRegex) // this helps us to understand that we are looking for a phone number\n\n   const LUCK_ERROR = 10%;\n   const result = luckPercent - LUCK_ERROR // this helps us to avoid working with magical numbers\n\n\\\n\n\nUsing encapsulation\nCreating private data through closure:\n\n\n   const createCounter = () => { \n     let count = 0;\n     return ({\n       click: () => count += 1,\n       getCount: () => count\n     });\n   };\n   const counter = createCounter();\n   counter.click();\n   counter.click();\n   counter.click();\n   console.log(\n     counter.getCount()\n   );\n\nHere we used a method that has access to private data inside the scope (lexical environment) of the function. These functions and methods have reference-based access to variables within the function, even after the function has been completed. These references are live, so if the state changes in the inner function, the changes are propagated to each privileged function. In other words, when we call counter.click(), it changes the value that counter.getCount() sees.\n\\\n   Creating private data through private fields:\n   class Counter {\n     #count = 0\n\n     click () {\n       this.#count += 1;\n     }\n     getCount () {\n       return this.#count.toLocaleString()\n     }\n   }\n\n   const myCounter = new Counter();\n   myCounter.click();\n   myCounter.click();\n   myCounter.click();\n   console.log(\n     myCounter.getCount()\n   );\n\n\\\n   New class fields are much better than underscores because they don't rely on convention but provide true encapsulation.\nNaming\nUsing camelCase notation:\n   const getSomeValue = () => {};\n\nNot using transliteration if your company/project language not English:\n   const tovar = {} // example from Russian: tovar = product\n\nAvoiding of using abstract naming:\n   const getProductNames = products.map(item => item.name) // less readable code\n\n   const getProductNames = products.map(product => product.name) // more readable code\n\nNaming constants in capital letters:\n   const BANNER_WIDTH = 300\n\nTypically, uppercase letters for naming constants or variables are used when the value is known before the script is executed and is written directly to the code, for example:\n   const BIRTHDAY = '4/18/1982';\n\nUse capital letters If the variable is evaluated during script execution, then lower case is used:\n   const age = someCode(BIRTHDAY);\n\nCalling variables speaking names:\n   const getProducts = () => {};\n   const addProductToCart = () => {};\n\nDeclaratively\nThe declarative coding style has a number of advantages over the imperative style:\ncode is easier to read\ncode is easier to maintain\ncomplex constructs are hidden behind methods and abstractions\nExample of comparing imperative code and declarative:\nfor(let i = 0; i < textArr.length; i++) {\n  if(arr[i] === 'Text to console log') {\n    console.log(arr[i])\n  }\n} // imperative code\n\ntextArr.filter(text => text === 'Text to console log').map(text => console.log(text)); // declarative code\n\nModularity\nA good practice is to split code into modules. Such code increases readability by separating the code into abstractions so it helps to hide hard-to-read code. Also, code is easier to test and easier to find errors accordingly.\n\\\nSo let’s see how to implement it by using the previous code:\nconst createCounter = () => { \n  let count = 0;\n  return ({\n    click: () => count += 1,\n    getCount: () => count\n  });\n}; // this part of code can be moved into separated file such as helper.ts\n\nconst counter = createCounter(); // this can be used inplace where it's needed because it's not nesessary to see how counter was actually created\n\n\\\nPeople don’t really need to see the whole code controlling a porcess and it’s quite fine to hide it behind a speaking name. Of course, sometimes you might have to supplement a functionality or see how it works. To do this you can freely go to the exact file to investigate it, but it happens not that often so no needs to keep it right in place of usage.\nCode style\nIt is a set of rules/projects/conventions that developers must follow. It can be described somewhere, for example, wiki section in Gitlab with examples of what to do and not to do.\n\\\nHere is an example of how I implement it in the project:\n\n\n\\\nMoreover, you can take a ready-made style code and implement it in your project, for example, the Airbnb code style.\nRepository\nIt is a successful repository management model when there are two main branches: develop, master and the rest are temporary branches. \n\\\nTemporary branches should contain a type of change such as release, feature, bugfix, or hotfix and task ticket number:\nfetaure/123\nbugfix/321\n\n\\\nWhen we start a new task, we go off a develop-branch. After passing the code review, we merge it back into the develop. Then, we collect releases from the develop branch link it to the release branch, and release it all to the master.\n\\\nWhat message should be sent when we commit some changes? ‘fixed a bug‘, ‘added a feature‘ - are not good examples of messages. \n\\\nA quality message is when it contains a capacious statement of the essence of change.\n\"added a banner component\" // - commit message example\n\nConclusion\nSumming up the article, here are the following tips that you should follow for writing quality code:\nkeep your code linear\nreduce nesting\nuse speaking names\nstrive for declaratively and modularity\nget code style\npay attention to git flow and commit messages\nuse linters, formatters as helpers in your project\n\\\n\\","dc:creator":"Olga Kiba","content":"Quality of code is directly connected with the following qualities: readability, controllability, readability and controlability.

As your process grows in size, it increases the transaction cost of each software version. Heavyweight processes were increasing in cost while machines were getting cheaper and compilation faster.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe SDLC was originally introduced to solve 2 problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Scaling software development to handle large-scale systems</p></li>\n<li><p>Specific technical limitations of the time</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>While the first problem remained, the technical limitations in 1990 were nothing like those in 1960. With technical constraints fading, the SDLC itself became a limiting factor in software delivery. The SDLC was an even greater problem in organizations that treated the process as the goal, rather than a way to achieve organizational outcomes.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe SDLC taught us that there <em>was</em> such as thing as <em>too much process</em>.</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"#\">  <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/BjV1EHGAKkRon4HOuee3REIX49i2-2022-12-12T22:03:33.825Z-clblcd83n00010as62cx8aldz\" alt=\"Capability versus process weight: Compared to code and fix, adding process improves software delivery until the process itself becomes the constraining factor\" /></a></p>\n<p>\\\nThere are complex relationships between batch size, deployment frequency, and risk. No matter how rigorously you test the functional and quality attributes of the system, the market risks remain until you release the software version to users. You only know that a feature is useful once people are using it.</p>\n<p>\\\nLarge batches also cause a common error in automation economics. Common wisdom says you either automate the tasks you do most often; or that calculate the manual effort of the task multiplied by its frequency.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis creates a paradox, as the reason you don't perform a task frequently is that it's manual and expensive. Automation does reduce manual work, but it also lets you perform tasks more frequently. </p>\n<p>\\\nAny economic model for automation should account for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Increased frequency</p></li>\n<li><p>Higher quality</p></li>\n<li><p>Fewer manual errors</p></li>\n<li><p>Reductions in the cost of delay</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the shift in technological constraints, a new competitive landscape emerged where organizations that were slow to market lost business to smaller and faster companies.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe SDLC was the correct solution at the time. Things have changed so much that it's no longer a valid approach to software delivery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doesdevopshaveansdlc\">Does DevOps have an SDLC?</h2>\n<p>The traditional SDLC is no longer seen as good practice. Though it's possible to avoid it with appropriate care, it's more common for traditional phased approaches to result in large batches that are passed between specialized teams. This is incompatible with a DevOps approach, which seeks to reduce the size of batches and increase collaboration between different disciplines.</p>\n<p>\\\nUsing an SDLC, you'd arrange 20 people into 5 specialist teams to work on phases such as analysis, design, development, testing, and operations. These <em>horizontal teams</em> would perform their specialist task with work passed from team to team, like the baton in a relay race.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn DevOps, you'd arrange people into 4 cross-functional teams who could deliver software without hand-offs. Your <em>vertical teams</em> could each deliver and run an isolated component, like the line of players moving the ball toward the scoring line in a game of rugby.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf you want to find out more about team design, Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais created <em><a href=\"https://teamtopologies.com/\">Team Topologies</a></em> to describe different interaction modes. You can use these to design healthy communication structures in your organization.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn DevOps and Continuous Delivery, there are still a series of tasks that need to be completed to deliver software. Instead of a structured SDLC, you focus on reducing batch size, creating autonomous vertical teams, and automating your deployment pipeline. You can design a process that complements the DevOps culture and capabilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"adevopsprocess\">A DevOps process</h2>\n<p>Continuous Delivery is central to a DevOps process, but you still need a way to discover and share what to build. Your context will guide your selections, but an example process is shown below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Impact Mapping: A collaborative technique for generating ideas connected to goals.</p></li>\n<li><p>Specification by Example: A way to communicate requirements using examples, which can be turned into automated acceptance tests.</p></li>\n<li><p>Continuous Delivery: A software delivery process built around an automated deployment pipeline.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Continuous Delivery doesn't depend on any specific technique for generating ideas. For example, you could switch from Impact Mapping to Lean Startup or any other technique from your product management toolkit. DevOps recognizes that you use appropriate Lean and Agile techniques alongside Continuous Delivery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thelegacyofthesdlc\">The legacy of the SDLC</h2>\n<p>For some organizations, the lasting part of the SDLC is a heavyweight set of phases and controls that limit software delivery and create high levels of market risk. This is an unfortunate negative result of many years of discovery.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe real legacy of the SDLC should be what we learned from the first 4 decades of software delivery:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You should work in small batches</p></li>\n<li><p>You should deploy frequently</p></li>\n<li><p>Start with a small working prototype, then evolve it</p></li>\n<li><p>It's possible to have too much process</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the right culture and capabilities, and a deployment pipeline that is as automated as possible, you should be able to deliver frequent high-quality software versions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>When you think of the software development life cycle now, just take your modern DevOps process and extend it to encompass the creation of the original idea, and consider how software could be retired when it's no longer valuable enough to maintain. The most important part (the bit in the middle where you continually increase the value of the software and improve its operation) is where most of your time and money will be spent.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe traditional formal method based on the systems development life cycle is no longer appropriate for software delivery, given the changes to the underlying constraints and competition.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Also published <a href=\"https://octopus.com/blog/devops-versus-sdlc\">here.</a> </p>","content:encodedSnippet":"\\\nIf you're using a traditional software development life cycle (SDLC) you may have questions about where DevOps fits in.

Heavyweight processes were increasing in cost while machines were getting cheaper and compilation faster.\n\\\nThe SDLC was originally introduced to solve 2 problems:\nScaling software development to handle large-scale systems\n\n\nSpecific technical limitations of the time\n\\\nWhile the first problem remained, the technical limitations in 1990 were nothing like those in 1960. With technical constraints fading, the SDLC itself became a limiting factor in software delivery. The SDLC was an even greater problem in organizations that treated the process as the goal, rather than a way to achieve organizational outcomes.\n\\\nThe SDLC taught us that there was such as thing as too much process.\n\\\n  \n\\\nThere are complex relationships between batch size, deployment frequency, and risk. No matter how rigorously you test the functional and quality attributes of the system, the market risks remain until you release the software version to users. You only know that a feature is useful once people are using it.\n\\\nLarge batches also cause a common error in automation economics. Common wisdom says you either automate the tasks you do most often; or that calculate the manual effort of the task multiplied by its frequency.\n\\\nThis creates a paradox, as the reason you don't perform a task frequently is that it's manual and expensive. Automation does reduce manual work, but it also lets you perform tasks more frequently. \n\\\nAny economic model for automation should account for:\nIncreased frequency\n\n\nHigher quality\n\n\nFewer manual errors\n\n\nReductions in the cost of delay\n\\\nIn addition to the shift in technological constraints, a new competitive landscape emerged where organizations that were slow to market lost business to smaller and faster companies.\n\\\nThe SDLC was the correct solution at the time. Things have changed so much that it's no longer a valid approach to software delivery.\nDoes DevOps have an SDLC?\nThe traditional SDLC is no longer seen as good practice. Though it's possible to avoid it with appropriate care, it's more common for traditional phased approaches to result in large batches that are passed between specialized teams. This is incompatible with a DevOps approach, which seeks to reduce the size of batches and increase collaboration between different disciplines.\n\\\nUsing an SDLC, you'd arrange 20 people into 5 specialist teams to work on phases such as analysis, design, development, testing, and operations. These horizontal teams would perform their specialist task with work passed from team to team, like the baton in a relay race.\n\\\nIn DevOps, you'd arrange people into 4 cross-functional teams who could deliver software without hand-offs. Your vertical teams could each deliver and run an isolated component, like the line of players moving the ball toward the scoring line in a game of rugby.\n\\\nIf you want to find out more about team design, Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais created Team Topologies to describe different interaction modes. You can use these to design healthy communication structures in your organization.\n\\\nIn DevOps and Continuous Delivery, there are still a series of tasks that need to be completed to deliver software. Instead of a structured SDLC, you focus on reducing batch size, creating autonomous vertical teams, and automating your deployment pipeline. You can design a process that complements the DevOps culture and capabilities.\nA DevOps process\nContinuous Delivery is central to a DevOps process, but you still need a way to discover and share what to build. Your context will guide your selections, but an example process is shown below:\nImpact Mapping: A collaborative technique for generating ideas connected to goals.\n\n\nSpecification by Example: A way to communicate requirements using examples, which can be turned into automated acceptance tests.\n\n\nContinuous Delivery: A software delivery process built around an automated deployment pipeline.\n\\\nContinuous Delivery doesn't depend on any specific technique for generating ideas. For example, you could switch from Impact Mapping to Lean Startup or any other technique from your product management toolkit. DevOps recognizes that you use appropriate Lean and Agile techniques alongside Continuous Delivery.\nThe legacy of the SDLC\nFor some organizations, the lasting part of the SDLC is a heavyweight set of phases and controls that limit software delivery and create high levels of market risk. This is an unfortunate negative result of many years of discovery.\n\\\nThe real legacy of the SDLC should be what we learned from the first 4 decades of software delivery:\nYou should work in small batches\n\n\nYou should deploy frequently\n\n\nStart with a small working prototype, then evolve it\n\n\nIt's possible to have too much process\n\\\nWith the right culture and capabilities, and a deployment pipeline that is as automated as possible, you should be able to deliver frequent high-quality software versions.\nConclusion\nWhen you think of the software development life cycle now, just take your modern DevOps process and extend it to encompass the creation of the original idea, and consider how software could be retired when it's no longer valuable enough to maintain. The most important part (the bit in the middle where you continually increase the value of the software and improve its operation) is where most of your time and money will be spent.\n\\\nThe traditional formal method based on the systems development life cycle is no longer appropriate for software delivery, given the changes to the underlying constraints and competition.\n\\\n\nAlso published here.","dc:creator":"Steve Fenton ","content":"Traditional software development life cycle (SDLC) is a traditional phased approach to software delivery.

I will try to do this chronologically but may jump forward and back to make some things absolutely crystal clear. </p>\n<p>\\\nSo here we go! Strap in, and enjoy the ride of the 2021-2022 Crypto contagion that no one truly realized until now.</p>\n<p>\\\n*Clears throat* We are going to start all the way back in 2020 with rough dates and a lot of introductions, so stay with me and you'll get the picture. </p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Digital Capital Group (DCG)</strong> is a Crypto conglomerate Corporation with many businesses in the industry, including <strong>CoinDesk</strong>, a notable blockchain news source, Genesis Trading, Crypto’s only prime brokerage (think Fidelity but only for big institutions), and <strong>Grayscale</strong>, one of the world’s largest digital currency asset managers. </p>\n<p>\\\nGrayscale had created a Bitcoin Trust Fund called the <strong>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</strong> that allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually holding it. </p>\n<p>\\\nOne of these investors was <strong>Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</strong>, a hedge fund founded by two MIT graduate traders, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, that had made money trading Crypto in 2019 and 2020.</p>\n<p>\\\nAlong with other Hedge Funds, they realized that GBTC could be used in <strong>==arbitrage trading==</strong> (selling two identical assets in two different markets for a profit) because GBTC was not priced based on the actual price of Bitcoin, but rather the NAV (Net Asset Value). </p>\n<p>\\\nTherefore, there was a difference in price and better yet for these traders, there was a premium on the GBTC because so many investors wanted it and thus traded at a higher price than the actual spot Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>\\\n3AC saw this opportunity to make essentially a “risk-free” trade and submitted documentation to own 6.1% of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. 3AC took out a loan with <strong>Genesis Trading (Genesis)</strong> to buy enough&nbsp;Bitcoin that would satisfy the 6.1% ownership. </p>\n<p>\\\nIn order to mint (create) new shares of GBTC, 3AC would then deposit this Bitcoin into the GBTC Trust and wait 6 months before being issued new shares of GBTC. </p>\n<p>\\\nThey would then sell the shares of GBTC to retail or other institutions for a premium since GBTC sold at a premium in much of 2020. <strong>To hit this point home, 3AC would buy actual spot Bitcoin and sell GBTC shares for more than they purchased the spot Bitcoin for.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nBut why did Genesis allow this? Is this fair? Well, Genesis had the incentive to bring in as much Bitcoin as possible into the GBTC Trust because Grayscale would receive 2% of the total AUM in the Trust as fees. </p>\n<p>\\\nOther Hedge Funds and banks followed this Strategy, like Alameda, which we will learn about soon enough.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn 2021, <strong>3AC used its plentiful amount of GBTC shares as collateral to take out ==margin loans== (allows user to borrow against the value of securities user already owns), to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH)</strong>, which had bull runs and reached All-Time Highs (ATHs) in the summer of 2021. </p>\n<p>\\\nIn November 2021, one of the founders of 3AC, Zhu Su, tweeted that 3AC would no longer invest in ETH and move into <strong>==Altcoins==</strong> (more risky alternative coins) to earn higher returns. </p>\n<p>\\\nAt the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, they invested $230 million into <strong>==illiquid==</strong> (not easily converted into cash) Avalanche (AVAX) coins and started to invest in what the industry calls “==ETH killers==”(Other blockchains that were created to replace Ethereum). </p>\n<p>\\\nIn March 2022, they became very bullish (invested heavily) in <strong>Terra Luna</strong>, another ETH Killer blockchain that used an Algorithmic Stablecoin along with their native token. </p>\n<p>\\\nWe will later see what happens to Terra Luna, but the blockchain was very popular during this time and many people thought Terra Luna was a profitable investment that was going to make them rich. </p>\n<p>\\\nThose people included 3AC and other hedge funds who had been seen as Crypto Trading Gods and been making a lot of money as seen by their extravagant spending on yachts and homes.&nbsp;  <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/2hamEXOaYecbNDKBS5B3CAXc71n1-2022-12-12T22:37:24.695Z-clbldkr4q00020as6chgehyuf\" alt=\"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Discount Hits Record Low at 26.5%\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>All the while, the collateral that was supporting all of 3AC’s margin loans with lending desks, GBTC shares, was now at a discount rather than a ==premium== (the price of one share of GBTC < price of one spot Bitcoin).</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nTherefore, 3AC did not want to pay their loans back because they would take a huge realized loss on their GBTC shares. This began the slow decline for 3AC as they needed a way for GBTC to return to being at a premium or for the trust to convert into an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).</p>\n<p>\\\nNow let's bring in the Macro: Inflation surged 7.5% on an annual basis in February 2022. The Fed now has the obligation to <strong>start raising interest rates</strong>, which shifts the whole Crypto paradigm and pulls down Crypto yields. </p>\n<p>\\\nCrypto thrives in a Risk-On environment, or when the Fed Funds rates are low, but does not do well in a Risk-Off environment, or when rates are high or being raised.</p>\n<p>\\\nBut back to Terra Luna because this is when things start getting interesting. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe Terra Luna foundation started to build their <strong>==Reserves==</strong> (assets they could hold to make investments and fund the ecosystem) with locked Avalanche tokens as well as 37,863 Bitcoins worth $1.5 billion made through <strong>==OTC==</strong> (Over the Counter) swaps with Genesis and 3AC. </p>\n<p>\\\nOf the $500 million worth of Bitcoin that 3AC sold to Terra Luna, <strong>$200 million of the Terra Luna Algo stablecoin was given to 3AC on May 5th.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>On May 13th, Terra Luna collapses and shakes the entire industry</strong>.

They borrow and take on as much <strong>==leverage==</strong> (using borrowed money) as possible from lending desks, like Voyager and BlockFi, and forge documents to prove they had enough collateral to pay them back. </p>\n<p>\\\nInstead of owning up to their <strong>==insolvency==</strong> (inability to pay debts), they decided to double down on their investments and take the money they should not have been lent to essentially gamble away.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet's check back in on Grayscale and see what they're up to. </p>\n<p>\\\nOn June 7th, 2022, Grayscale hired Donald B, Verrilli Jr., former solicitor general of the US, as legal counsel to fight the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) in the Supreme Court in anticipation that the SEC denies Grayscale’s proposal to convert the GBTC Trust to an ETF. </p>\n<p>\\\nOnce again, many hedge funds and other firms had GBTC as collateral, but at this point in time, GBTC was trading at a discount of -30%. H<strong>ence, these firms were only able to access 70% of their collateral in Bitcoin because of the discount on GBTC, which wouldn’t happen if it was an ETF.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nTherefore, Grayscale wanted to fix this discount problem on their GBTC by converting it into an ETF. </p>\n<p>\\\nThis would help 3AC, Alameda, and many more players in the space become more solvent and avoid the risk of bankruptcy by unlocking capital locked in the collateral they held with Genesis. </p>\n<p>\\\nOn June 29th, 2022, Grayscale sued the SEC for not allowing the GBTC Trust to convert into a Bitcoin Spot ETF. However, this was just a little too late…</p>\n<p>\\\nOn June 15th, 2022, <strong>BlockFi, a Crypto lending company, liquidated 3AC’s margin loans, which was the eventual collapse of 3AC.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\n3AC was liquidated because they simply couldn’t make payments on their margin loans and used all of the borrowed funds to invest in risky altcoins like Terra Luna which essentially went to $0.</p>\n<p>\\\nBlockFi had also been partaking in GBTC arbitrage trading as they had sent customer deposited Bitcoin to GBTC or 3AC. Therefore, a large number of BlockFi’s Bitcoins were illiquid. This is no Bueno for BlockFi and eventually caused them to declare Bankruptcy. </p>\n<p>\\\nContinuing with the 3AC contagion, Genesis lent out $2.36 billion to 3AC but was bailed out by their parent company, DCG. </p>\n<p>\\\nVoyager, another Crypto lender, gave $660 million in uncollateralized loans to 3AC and was also about to go <strong>==insolvent==</strong>( inability to pay debts). However, Alameda came to the rescue and bailed Voyager out with a $200 million cash &amp; USDC loan and a 15,000 Bitcoin loan. </p>\n<p>\\\nFTX then bails out BlockFi with a $400 million loan. <strong>All these bailouts made FTX and Alameda look very solvent and a savior in the Crypto space.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nBut wasn’t Alameda also arbitrage trading GBTC in 2020 and had GTBC collateral with Genesis which was at a discount along with the other hedge funds? How did they have enough money to bail out these other firms? </p>\n<p>\\\nIf you were thinking about these questions, YOU have been following along!</p>\n<p>\\\nTo clear some things up, </p>\n<p>\\\n1) <strong>==Leverage== is using borrowed funds to increase a trading position</strong>, </p>\n<p>\\\n2) <strong>A</strong> <strong>==collateralized loan== is when a user puts up funds (collateral) to back their borrowing</strong>, </p>\n<p>\\\n3) <strong>==Liquidating a margin loan== occurs if the value of that collateral drops past an agreed-upon level; the user’s collateral will be sold and the lender will use that money to pay off the initial loan</strong>, and…</p>\n<p>\\\n4) all of these institutions mentioned above, besides Terra Luna, were centralized. The decentralized part of Crypto had no examples of crashes or collapses during this time and Decentralized Applications like Uniswap, Aave, and Maker did not lose any funds. </p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>The difference between decentralized and centralized is ==centralization== means there is a central entity that controls the product/service, while ==decentralization== is when there is no central entity and runs permissionless.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nLet's take a quick emotional pause and set the tone. I know you saw a bunch of numbers and new names, but let's get the main point across here. The Crypto industry was vulnerable and fragile in the summer of 2022, but we were learning from this as a community. </p>\n<p>\\\nIt didn't matter if you were a hedge fund, institutional investor, retail investor, or someone who had a couple of hundred bucks of Bitcoin; everyone was suffering because prices had crashed dramatically with Bitcoin and Ethereum now down 75% from ATHs as of July 2021. </p>\n<p>\\\nThis price collapse was due to two main events: </p>\n<p>\\\n1) <strong>All of that collateral being used to hold up 3AC and other Hedge Fund loans was liquidated and caused selling pressure</strong>, and</p>\n<p>\\\n2) <strong>Investors panic selling their Terra Luna tokens and similar risky tokens</strong>. </p>\n<p>\\\nBut why am I telling you this? It’s because of this feeling of mistrust and the feeling that any institution, no matter its prestige or public image, can fall and deceive millions if the risk is not properly managed. This feeling was amplified due to three key things: <strong>SBF, FTX, and Alameda.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/2hamEXOaYecbNDKBS5B3CAXc71n1-2022-12-12T22:37:24.705Z-clbldkr4x00040as660n38o7b\" alt=\"FTX:  A centralized Crypto Exchange known for its super bowl commercial and billions of dollars on its platform \" /></p>\n<p>\\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/2hamEXOaYecbNDKBS5B3CAXc71n1-2022-12-12T22:37:24.706Z-clbldkr5000050as6f6pz6gn1\" alt=\"Alameda Research: A Hedge Fund known for being one of the most prominent in the industry \" /> \\n </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/2hamEXOaYecbNDKBS5B3CAXc71n1-bma3rxc.jpeg\" alt=\"SBF: Sam Bankman Fried, known for his profitable trading and friendliness with regulators \" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nFirst, some context into what each of these words are. SBF is Sam Bankman Fried, a 30-year-old Wizkid out of MIT that made billions arbitrage trading Bitcoin. FTX is a centralized Crypto Exchange that was founded by SBF in 2019 that was used to buy Crypto using Fiat money. </p>\n<p>\\\nFinally, Alameda is a Hedge Fund also founded by SBF in 2017 that was used to trade Crypto using technical trading methods with the possibility to use leverage. Another thing to note about leverage is that the technique can increase returns exponentially, but also magnify losses.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet's jump forward from June 2022 to November 2, 2022, <strong>when a CoinDesk reporter published a <strong><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/\">piece</a></strong> showcasing Alameda’s Balance sheet</strong>, “that balance sheet is full of FTX – specifically,<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/07/ftt-token-surges-7-as-ftx-partners-with-visa/\"> the FTT token</a>”, Ian Allison reports. </p>\n<p>\\\nFTT is a utility token for the FTX platform that does not entitle users to a part of the platform revenue or represent a share in FTX. Furthermore, it is not backed, nor does it give control over governance decisions or FTX’s treasury. </p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Essentially, it is a speculative token that does not offer the investor any true benefits.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nAnyways, SBF was asked countless times about the conflict of interest between his Hedge Fund and Exchange, but he always noted that there were “walls'' in place to keep the two entities separate. </p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, this article suggests that Alameda and FTX were more closely tied together than everyone thought, and Alameda was sitting on $5.82 billion worth of FTT, where $2.16 billion was being used as collateral. </p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>The problem: if these two entities were sharing the same balance sheet and pool of funds, there is a chance that customer deposits from FTX were being misappropriated.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nHaving a significant amount of a token on your Balance Sheet that was created by your founder is definitely not a “Best Practices” and is risky in itself to use a non-independent asset as collateral. </p>\n<p>\\\nSo why would Alameda have so much FTT on its Balance sheet? We will find out soon enough, but essentially, FTX was able to mint new tokens whenever they wanted and Alameda was indeed very closely tied to FTX.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet's jump back to <strong>May 2022.</strong> While the contagion of Terra Luna and 3AC rippled through the industry, <strong>Alameda was also hit hard and suffered losses on its GBTC and altcoin positions</strong>.</p>\n<p>\\\nGenesis began to recall the margin loans made to Alameda when its collateral dropped due to Crypto prices declining. </p>\n<p>\\\nAlameda was not equipped to make these loan payments because Alameda had invested those borrowed funds into investments that were illiquid or no longer easily accessible. </p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, unlike 3AC, Alameda was able to receive funds from FTX in the form of ETH and FTT that would be used to pay those Genesis loans.</p>\n<p>\\\nCEO of Alameda, Caroline Ellison, a 28-year-old Stanford graduate who may or may not have been in a romantic relationship with SBF, would later explain to her staff that Alameda had taken out margin loans and used the money to make venture capital investments and other expenditures, <strong>including $72 million worth of Bahamian Real Estate.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nAfter the CoinDesk article was released, ChangPeng Zhao, or CZ, the CEO of rival exchange Binance, became aware of the suspicious Alameda Balance Sheet. Binance had invested early on in FTX and held a substantial amount of FTT. </p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>CZ went to Twitter to notify his followers that Binance would sell $2.1 billion worth of FTT due to suspicious activity between Alameda and FTX.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nIn her tweet that has now been deleted, Caroline Ellison offered to OTC buy all of Binance’s FTT holdings for $22 per token, leading to speculation that Alameda may have had loans that would have otherwise been liquidated if the price of FTT fell below $22. </p>\n<p>\\\nCZ did not entertain this offer, which put the market into panic mode. A sell-off of FTT and other tokens on FTX began as net outflows of <strong>$451.1 million</strong> were withdrawn from FTX days after the article was published.</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/2hamEXOaYecbNDKBS5B3CAXc71n1-2022-12-12T22:37:24.758Z-clbldkr6e00090as66orsduji\" alt=\"CZ's announcement to sell FTT\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nOn November 8, 2022, FTX paused withdrawals and CZ shared that Binance would enter into a strategic transaction with FTX through a non-binding Letter of Intent to fully acquire FTX and help cover its liquidity crunch. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe industry was in shock as the second-largest Crypto exchange was now set to be acquired. </p>\n<p>\\\nThings got even crazier a day after the proposed acquisition when CZ decided to walk away from the transaction after conducting due diligence and uncovering <strong>FTX was insolvent.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nDuring this whole period, SBF was tweeting about “protecting consumers” and how “users’ funds are FINE”, but in reality, FTX did not have enough money for customers to withdraw from. A few days later on November 11, 2022, SBF stepped down as CEO and FTX declared bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/2hamEXOaYecbNDKBS5B3CAXc71n1-2022-12-12T22:37:24.757Z-clbldkr6d00080as67adraa1z\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>But HOW? FTX and SBF were saviors, bailing out all of the other firms in the industry; how could they be suddenly bankrupt? </p>\n<p>\\\nThe following will dive into these questions in more detail but simply put: <strong>SBF created FTX on a house of cards and fooled the entire industry with his altruistic persona.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nTo recap, SBF was noted as a Crypto Genius, and many thought of him as the face of Crypto after appearing on the Forbes cover and being seen with celebrity endorsements and experienced investors. </p>\n<p>\\\nFTX gained worldwide recognition and was considered a trusted exchange to execute trades and hold users' funds. But as I told you before, it does not matter how well-perceived someone is, they can still do very bad things. </p>\n<p>\\\nIn the case of SBF, we now know that he was playing life like a video game and trying to level up his “life score” by using funds to buy whatever he wanted to make himself seem more powerful, including a $1 billion personal loan from FTX. </p>\n<p>\\\nHow did he do this? Let’s dig a little deeper with the help of Nansen.ai’s report titled, <strong>“<strong><a href=\"https://www.nansen.ai/research/blockchain-analysis-the-collapse-of-alameda-and-ftx\">Blockchain Analysis: The Collapse of Alameda and FTX</a></strong>”</strong>. With all of this information in mind, I believe this is what happened with FTX, SBF, and Alameda. Let's talk FTT.</p>\n<p>\\\nAlameda and FTX owned the vast majority of the total FTT supply from the very beginning, meaning:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The actual <strong>==circulating supply==</strong> (how much FTT is in the open market) is low when compared to the total supply</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prices can be easily influenced to move up (or down) with small amounts of FTT</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Since both Alameda and FTX held the majority of FTT supply, if one entity is forced to sell its FTT holdings, then the other entity may consequently take a huge hit to its balance sheet</p>\n<p>\\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/2hamEXOaYecbNDKBS5B3CAXc71n1-2022-12-12T22:37:24.755Z-clbldkr6b00070as6bwgud9g8\" alt=\"The Process Alameda and FTX went through to take out margin loans and Borrow billions\" />Out of the 350 million (m) total supply of FTT, 280m of it was controlled by FTX <strong>(~80%)</strong> and out of the 59.3m tokens for seed and private rounds, around 27m <strong>(or roughly 46%)</strong> ended up with Alameda, where almost all the total FTT token supply had to go through Alameda at some point in its distribution. </p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nTherefore, Alameda had a direct role in the development of FTT, and the entities were connected from FTX’s inception.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe initial success of Alameda, FTX, and FTT led to a rise in the value of Alameda’s balance sheet during the 2020-2021 bull market with FTT reaching ATHs in the summer of 2021. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe high value in Alameda’s FTT position was most likely used as collateral by Alameda to borrow from Genesis and other lending desks. </p>\n<p>\\\nAs previously mentioned, t<strong>he borrowed funds were used to make illiquid investments causing FTT to become a central weakness for Alameda if the price of FTT decreased too much.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nEffectively, Alameda was in a leveraged long position, where they were borrowing funds using their high-value FTT position that they needed to stay high (long) or else their loans would be recalled.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis strategy worked perfectly in a bull market when prices were at ATHs. </p>\n<p>\\\nBut remember that huge Crypto crash in May/June that caused Terra Luna, 3AC, and a bunch more firms to collapse…. Well right around that time, liquidity quickly started to dry up as borrowing rates &amp; margin calls increased, and creditors started to recall their loans due to general market conditions worsening. </p>\n<p>\\\nGiven that significant portions of Alameda’s balance sheet had consisted of illiquid assets, <strong>Alameda was on the brink of a ==liquidity crunch== (in need of cash) as the rest of the Crypto industry was crumbling.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nDue to the control SBF had over both FTX and Alameda, he knew that if Alameda declared bankruptcy, then an FTT liquidation would occur and cause the price to fall dramatically. </p>\n<p>\\\nWe believe the margin call for Alameda’s FTT position was $22, therefore, if the price of FTT fell below $22 and Alameda did not make payments to meet the margin level, then lending desks would have no option but to sell the FTT collateral. </p>\n<p>\\\nAs a large holder of FTT, FTX would see its FTT holdings crushed. With lending desks like Genesis now recalling their loans to Alameda, <strong>SBF decided to send FTX Customer Deposits to Alameda to satisfy their outstanding loan payments.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nAgain, this was due to Alameda’s illiquid investments in Terra Luna, GBTC, and others. In return for customer deposits, Alameda deposited as much as ~$4 billion worth of FTT on FTX as collateral between early June and July with the majority being sent during the 3AC collapse. </p>\n<p>\\\nSBF was able to move customer deposits without external auditors knowing due to a <strong>“Backdoor” software protocol and bespoke accounting practices</strong> SBF created in his FTX exchange that would not alert anyone when funds were lent out, like to Alameda.</p>\n<p>\\\nBut why did FTX bail out Voyager and BlockFi during this time? It was because those entities were holding millions of FTT, and other tokens related to FTX. </p>\n<p>\\\nTherefore, if he let those firms go bankrupt, those tokens would have been liquidated and the price of FTT, among others, would decrease and cause FTX to go insolvent. </p>\n<p>\\\nInstead of owning up to their highly leveraged positions and declaring bankruptcy, Alameda and FTX decided to double down and acquire all these firms to stay solvent long enough to make all of the money back. </p>\n<p>\\\nIt solidified FTX’s image as a solvent and responsible institution, which helped FTT's price stay above $22 for the rest of the summer and kept people from digging too much into the two entities.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo reiterate, <strong>FTX and Alameda still had leveraged positions outstanding with FTT as the collateral with a margin call of about $22.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>SBF used customer deposits to cover up the liquidity crunch in the meantime while attempting to make the loss whole with the funds Alameda had available.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, Alameda was not able to make up for those losses in time even with the continued help from FTX before the November 2nd article was released. </p>\n<p>\\\nAlthough the November 2nd article exposed Alameda and FTX to the public, it was the <strong>==overleveraged positions==</strong> (more debt than collateral), using FTT as collateral, and investments in illiquid and risky tokens that were the true downfall for both firms. </p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, the true contagion started with the GBTC arbitrage trade that 3AC, Alameda, and many other firms participated in during 2020 which was mentioned earlier. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe fallout from these three entities (SBF, FTX, and Alameda) has shaken the Crypto industry and has made long-time enthusiasts question their loyalty to such a selfish industry. </p>\n<p>\\\nMillions of regular people held billions of dollars in FTX as a safe and trusted haven, which SBF took advantage of and used to prop up his own self-esteem.</p>\n<p>\\\nUnlike most other fraudsters who have stayed silent after committing their crime, SBF sought out attention including being interviewed at the New York Times (NYT) Dealbook Conference. </p>\n<p>\\\nHe was asked multiple times during the NYT interview as well as interviews with the Wall Street Journal and Good Morning America if he knew about the misappropriation of Customer Deposits to Alameda which he squeamishly deflected to the excuse that customers with Margin accounts allowed FTX to use their digital assets to lend out to Alameda. </p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Essentially, SBF is making the excuse that somewhere in the Terms of Service it gives FTX the ability to lend out customer digital assets if the customer uses a margin account and that is why customer deposits were sent to Alameda.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nBut what about the regular customers who never allowed FTX to lend out their digital assets? The Terms of Service, seen below, clearly state that none of the digital assets in a customer’s account are owned or may be loaned out to FTX. </p>\n<p>\\\nThroughout these interviews, he was visibly uncomfortable and tried to answer the interviewer’s questions without actually answering the questions at all. </p>\n<p>\\\nHe has continued to seek attention through interviews, but when the hard questions like, “where did all the money go?” were asked, he bounced around two answers: “I don’t know” and “I don’t know what to say”. </p>\n<p>\\\n@CoffeeZilla, a famous Crypto investigator, had the chance to interview SBF over a Twitter space and drilled SBF on the Terms of Service question. </p>\n<p>\\\nCoffeeZilla was finally able to get SBF to admit that he was treating all customers equally when it comes to withdrawals, even though there were supposed to be two separate pools of funds for regular and margin account customers. </p>\n<p>\\\nTherefore, <strong>SBF admitted that FTX was commingling customer funds and was not fulfilling their obligations of the Terms of Service, which is no doubt FRAUD.</strong> Why is it fraud? </p>\n<p>\\\nBecause SBF did not follow the Terms of Service that customers agreed to and rather “loaned” (stole) customer digital assets, which they never approved. This is why SBF will go to jail for a very long time.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/2hamEXOaYecbNDKBS5B3CAXc71n1-2022-12-12T22:37:24.753Z-clbldkr6a00060as6do38dgpn\" alt=\"Image\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAll I can say is that I am still committed to this technology, and I will keep writing so more people can be informed about the diverse applications of Blockchain. </p>\n<p>\\\nBad actors should not represent our industry when there are thousands of intelligent innovators building sophisticated and beneficial applications for the masses. </p>\n<p>\\\nFor every SBF, there is a Vitalik Buetrin, a Brian Armstrong, a Balaji Srinivasan, and many more lesser-known people fighting for financial freedom.

I will try to do this chronologically but may jump forward and back to make some things absolutely crystal clear. \n\\\nSo here we go! Strap in, and enjoy the ride of the 2021-2022 Crypto contagion that no one truly realized until now.\n\\\n*Clears throat* We are going to start all the way back in 2020 with rough dates and a lot of introductions, so stay with me and you'll get the picture. \n\\\nDigital Capital Group (DCG) is a Crypto conglomerate Corporation with many businesses in the industry, including CoinDesk, a notable blockchain news source, Genesis Trading, Crypto’s only prime brokerage (think Fidelity but only for big institutions), and Grayscale, one of the world’s largest digital currency asset managers. \n\\\nGrayscale had created a Bitcoin Trust Fund called the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) that allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually holding it. \n\\\nOne of these investors was Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a hedge fund founded by two MIT graduate traders, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, that had made money trading Crypto in 2019 and 2020.\n\\\nAlong with other Hedge Funds, they realized that GBTC could be used in ==arbitrage trading== (selling two identical assets in two different markets for a profit) because GBTC was not priced based on the actual price of Bitcoin, but rather the NAV (Net Asset Value). \n\\\nTherefore, there was a difference in price and better yet for these traders, there was a premium on the GBTC because so many investors wanted it and thus traded at a higher price than the actual spot Bitcoin.\n\\\n3AC saw this opportunity to make essentially a “risk-free” trade and submitted documentation to own 6.1% of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. 3AC took out a loan with Genesis Trading (Genesis) to buy enough Bitcoin that would satisfy the 6.1% ownership. \n\\\nIn order to mint (create) new shares of GBTC, 3AC would then deposit this Bitcoin into the GBTC Trust and wait 6 months before being issued new shares of GBTC. \n\\\nThey would then sell the shares of GBTC to retail or other institutions for a premium since GBTC sold at a premium in much of 2020. To hit this point home, 3AC would buy actual spot Bitcoin and sell GBTC shares for more than they purchased the spot Bitcoin for. \n\\\nBut why did Genesis allow this? Is this fair? Well, Genesis had the incentive to bring in as much Bitcoin as possible into the GBTC Trust because Grayscale would receive 2% of the total AUM in the Trust as fees. \n\\\nOther Hedge Funds and banks followed this Strategy, like Alameda, which we will learn about soon enough.\n\\\nIn 2021, 3AC used its plentiful amount of GBTC shares as collateral to take out ==margin loans== (allows user to borrow against the value of securities user already owns), to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), which had bull runs and reached All-Time Highs (ATHs) in the summer of 2021. \n\\\nIn November 2021, one of the founders of 3AC, Zhu Su, tweeted that 3AC would no longer invest in ETH and move into ==Altcoins== (more risky alternative coins) to earn higher returns. \n\\\nAt the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, they invested $230 million into ==illiquid== (not easily converted into cash) Avalanche (AVAX) coins and started to invest in what the industry calls “==ETH killers==”(Other blockchains that were created to replace Ethereum). \n\\\nIn March 2022, they became very bullish (invested heavily) in Terra Luna, another ETH Killer blockchain that used an Algorithmic Stablecoin along with their native token. \n\\\nWe will later see what happens to Terra Luna, but the blockchain was very popular during this time and many people thought Terra Luna was a profitable investment that was going to make them rich. \n\\\nThose people included 3AC and other hedge funds who had been seen as Crypto Trading Gods and been making a lot of money as seen by their extravagant spending on yachts and homes.   \n\\\nAll the while, the collateral that was supporting all of 3AC’s margin loans with lending desks, GBTC shares, was now at a discount rather than a ==premium== (the price of one share of GBTC  \n\\\nTherefore, 3AC did not want to pay their loans back because they would take a huge realized loss on their GBTC shares. This began the slow decline for 3AC as they needed a way for GBTC to return to being at a premium or for the trust to convert into an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).\n\\\nNow let's bring in the Macro: Inflation surged 7.5% on an annual basis in February 2022. The Fed now has the obligation to start raising interest rates, which shifts the whole Crypto paradigm and pulls down Crypto yields. \n\\\nCrypto thrives in a Risk-On environment, or when the Fed Funds rates are low, but does not do well in a Risk-Off environment, or when rates are high or being raised.\n\\\nBut back to Terra Luna because this is when things start getting interesting. \n\\\nThe Terra Luna foundation started to build their ==Reserves== (assets they could hold to make investments and fund the ecosystem) with locked Avalanche tokens as well as 37,863 Bitcoins worth $1.5 billion made through ==OTC== (Over the Counter) swaps with Genesis and 3AC. \n\\\nOf the $500 million worth of Bitcoin that 3AC sold to Terra Luna, $200 million of the Terra Luna Algo stablecoin was given to 3AC on May 5th.\n\\\nOn May 13th, Terra Luna collapses and shakes the entire industry. Remember when I said a lot of investors believed in Terra Luna, well it all ended up being a huge experiment, and the creator, Do Kwon, did not know if his Algorithmic backed stablecoin was going to work. \n\\\nAll it took was a couple of rumors and for the Algorithmic stablecoin (USTC) to slip below the $1 peg for holders of these Terra Luna tokens (LUNC)  to start withdrawing and selling. This created an imbalance in the algorithm and basically crashed the Terra Luna ecosystem and tokens. \n\\\nSuffice it to say, 3AC was in a predicament with $200 million lost due to USTC going to near $0 and their GBTC shares at a huge discount.\n\\\n \n\\\nLet’s go back to before the Terra Luna collapse; Bitcoin and ETH were down 60% from ATHs in early 2022. Bitcoin and ETH were a part of the collateral base for 3AC and Alameda as well as Avalanche and Terra Luna, which were down 80% from ATHs. \n\\\n3AC was in a tough position with billions of illiquid assets on hand that could not be sold for the appropriate price. \n\\\nWhat do they do? They borrow and take on as much ==leverage== (using borrowed money) as possible from lending desks, like Voyager and BlockFi, and forge documents to prove they had enough collateral to pay them back. \n\\\nInstead of owning up to their ==insolvency== (inability to pay debts), they decided to double down on their investments and take the money they should not have been lent to essentially gamble away.\n\\\nLet's check back in on Grayscale and see what they're up to. \n\\\nOn June 7th, 2022, Grayscale hired Donald B, Verrilli Jr., former solicitor general of the US, as legal counsel to fight the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) in the Supreme Court in anticipation that the SEC denies Grayscale’s proposal to convert the GBTC Trust to an ETF. \n\\\nOnce again, many hedge funds and other firms had GBTC as collateral, but at this point in time, GBTC was trading at a discount of -30%. Hence, these firms were only able to access 70% of their collateral in Bitcoin because of the discount on GBTC, which wouldn’t happen if it was an ETF.\n\\\nTherefore, Grayscale wanted to fix this discount problem on their GBTC by converting it into an ETF. \n\\\nThis would help 3AC, Alameda, and many more players in the space become more solvent and avoid the risk of bankruptcy by unlocking capital locked in the collateral they held with Genesis. \n\\\nOn June 29th, 2022, Grayscale sued the SEC for not allowing the GBTC Trust to convert into a Bitcoin Spot ETF. However, this was just a little too late…\n\\\nOn June 15th, 2022, BlockFi, a Crypto lending company, liquidated 3AC’s margin loans, which was the eventual collapse of 3AC. \n\\\n3AC was liquidated because they simply couldn’t make payments on their margin loans and used all of the borrowed funds to invest in risky altcoins like Terra Luna which essentially went to $0.\n\\\nBlockFi had also been partaking in GBTC arbitrage trading as they had sent customer deposited Bitcoin to GBTC or 3AC. Therefore, a large number of BlockFi’s Bitcoins were illiquid. This is no Bueno for BlockFi and eventually caused them to declare Bankruptcy. \n\\\nContinuing with the 3AC contagion, Genesis lent out $2.36 billion to 3AC but was bailed out by their parent company, DCG. \n\\\nVoyager, another Crypto lender, gave $660 million in uncollateralized loans to 3AC and was also about to go ==insolvent==( inability to pay debts). However, Alameda came to the rescue and bailed Voyager out with a $200 million cash & USDC loan and a 15,000 Bitcoin loan. \n\\\nFTX then bails out BlockFi with a $400 million loan. All these bailouts made FTX and Alameda look very solvent and a savior in the Crypto space.\n\\\nBut wasn’t Alameda also arbitrage trading GBTC in 2020 and had GTBC collateral with Genesis which was at a discount along with the other hedge funds? How did they have enough money to bail out these other firms? \n\\\nIf you were thinking about these questions, YOU have been following along!\n\\\nTo clear some things up, \n\\\n1) ==Leverage== is using borrowed funds to increase a trading position, \n\\\n2) A ==collateralized loan== is when a user puts up funds (collateral) to back their borrowing, \n\\\n3) ==Liquidating a margin loan== occurs if the value of that collateral drops past an agreed-upon level; the user’s collateral will be sold and the lender will use that money to pay off the initial loan, and…\n\\\n4) all of these institutions mentioned above, besides Terra Luna, were centralized. The decentralized part of Crypto had no examples of crashes or collapses during this time and Decentralized Applications like Uniswap, Aave, and Maker did not lose any funds. \n\\\nThe difference between decentralized and centralized is ==centralization== means there is a central entity that controls the product/service, while ==decentralization== is when there is no central entity and runs permissionless.\n\\\nLet's take a quick emotional pause and set the tone. I know you saw a bunch of numbers and new names, but let's get the main point across here. The Crypto industry was vulnerable and fragile in the summer of 2022, but we were learning from this as a community. \n\\\nIt didn't matter if you were a hedge fund, institutional investor, retail investor, or someone who had a couple of hundred bucks of Bitcoin; everyone was suffering because prices had crashed dramatically with Bitcoin and Ethereum now down 75% from ATHs as of July 2021. \n\\\nThis price collapse was due to two main events: \n\\\n1) All of that collateral being used to hold up 3AC and other Hedge Fund loans was liquidated and caused selling pressure, and\n\\\n2) Investors panic selling their Terra Luna tokens and similar risky tokens. \n\\\nBut why am I telling you this? It’s because of this feeling of mistrust and the feeling that any institution, no matter its prestige or public image, can fall and deceive millions if the risk is not properly managed. This feeling was amplified due to three key things: SBF, FTX, and Alameda.\n\n\\n   \\n \n\n\\\n\\\nFirst, some context into what each of these words are. SBF is Sam Bankman Fried, a 30-year-old Wizkid out of MIT that made billions arbitrage trading Bitcoin. FTX is a centralized Crypto Exchange that was founded by SBF in 2019 that was used to buy Crypto using Fiat money. \n\\\nFinally, Alameda is a Hedge Fund also founded by SBF in 2017 that was used to trade Crypto using technical trading methods with the possibility to use leverage. Another thing to note about leverage is that the technique can increase returns exponentially, but also magnify losses.\n\\\nLet's jump forward from June 2022 to November 2, 2022, when a CoinDesk reporter published a piece showcasing Alameda’s Balance sheet, “that balance sheet is full of FTX – specifically, the FTT token”, Ian Allison reports. \n\\\nFTT is a utility token for the FTX platform that does not entitle users to a part of the platform revenue or represent a share in FTX. Furthermore, it is not backed, nor does it give control over governance decisions or FTX’s treasury. \n\\\nEssentially, it is a speculative token that does not offer the investor any true benefits. \n\\\nAnyways, SBF was asked countless times about the conflict of interest between his Hedge Fund and Exchange, but he always noted that there were “walls'' in place to keep the two entities separate. \n\\\nHowever, this article suggests that Alameda and FTX were more closely tied together than everyone thought, and Alameda was sitting on $5.82 billion worth of FTT, where $2.16 billion was being used as collateral. \n\\\nThe problem: if these two entities were sharing the same balance sheet and pool of funds, there is a chance that customer deposits from FTX were being misappropriated. \n\\\nHaving a significant amount of a token on your Balance Sheet that was created by your founder is definitely not a “Best Practices” and is risky in itself to use a non-independent asset as collateral. \n\\\nSo why would Alameda have so much FTT on its Balance sheet? We will find out soon enough, but essentially, FTX was able to mint new tokens whenever they wanted and Alameda was indeed very closely tied to FTX.\n\\\nLet's jump back to May 2022. While the contagion of Terra Luna and 3AC rippled through the industry, Alameda was also hit hard and suffered losses on its GBTC and altcoin positions.\n\\\nGenesis began to recall the margin loans made to Alameda when its collateral dropped due to Crypto prices declining. \n\\\nAlameda was not equipped to make these loan payments because Alameda had invested those borrowed funds into investments that were illiquid or no longer easily accessible. \n\\\nHowever, unlike 3AC, Alameda was able to receive funds from FTX in the form of ETH and FTT that would be used to pay those Genesis loans.\n\\\nCEO of Alameda, Caroline Ellison, a 28-year-old Stanford graduate who may or may not have been in a romantic relationship with SBF, would later explain to her staff that Alameda had taken out margin loans and used the money to make venture capital investments and other expenditures, including $72 million worth of Bahamian Real Estate.\n\\\nAfter the CoinDesk article was released, ChangPeng Zhao, or CZ, the CEO of rival exchange Binance, became aware of the suspicious Alameda Balance Sheet. Binance had invested early on in FTX and held a substantial amount of FTT. \n\\\nCZ went to Twitter to notify his followers that Binance would sell $2.1 billion worth of FTT due to suspicious activity between Alameda and FTX. \n\\\nIn her tweet that has now been deleted, Caroline Ellison offered to OTC buy all of Binance’s FTT holdings for $22 per token, leading to speculation that Alameda may have had loans that would have otherwise been liquidated if the price of FTT fell below $22. \n\\\nCZ did not entertain this offer, which put the market into panic mode. A sell-off of FTT and other tokens on FTX began as net outflows of $451.1 million were withdrawn from FTX days after the article was published.\n\\\n\\\n\\\n \n\\\nOn November 8, 2022, FTX paused withdrawals and CZ shared that Binance would enter into a strategic transaction with FTX through a non-binding Letter of Intent to fully acquire FTX and help cover its liquidity crunch. \n\\\nThe industry was in shock as the second-largest Crypto exchange was now set to be acquired. \n\\\nThings got even crazier a day after the proposed acquisition when CZ decided to walk away from the transaction after conducting due diligence and uncovering FTX was insolvent. \n\\\nDuring this whole period, SBF was tweeting about “protecting consumers” and how “users’ funds are FINE”, but in reality, FTX did not have enough money for customers to withdraw from. A few days later on November 11, 2022, SBF stepped down as CEO and FTX declared bankruptcy.\n\\\n \nBut HOW? FTX and SBF were saviors, bailing out all of the other firms in the industry; how could they be suddenly bankrupt? \n\\\nThe following will dive into these questions in more detail but simply put: SBF created FTX on a house of cards and fooled the entire industry with his altruistic persona.\n\\\nTo recap, SBF was noted as a Crypto Genius, and many thought of him as the face of Crypto after appearing on the Forbes cover and being seen with celebrity endorsements and experienced investors. \n\\\nFTX gained worldwide recognition and was considered a trusted exchange to execute trades and hold users' funds. But as I told you before, it does not matter how well-perceived someone is, they can still do very bad things. \n\\\nIn the case of SBF, we now know that he was playing life like a video game and trying to level up his “life score” by using funds to buy whatever he wanted to make himself seem more powerful, including a $1 billion personal loan from FTX. \n\\\nHow did he do this? Let’s dig a little deeper with the help of Nansen.ai’s report titled, “Blockchain Analysis: The Collapse of Alameda and FTX”. With all of this information in mind, I believe this is what happened with FTX, SBF, and Alameda. Let's talk FTT.\n\\\nAlameda and FTX owned the vast majority of the total FTT supply from the very beginning, meaning:\n\\\n\nThe actual ==circulating supply== (how much FTT is in the open market) is low when compared to the total supply\n\\\n\nPrices can be easily influenced to move up (or down) with small amounts of FTT\n\\\n\n\nSince both Alameda and FTX held the majority of FTT supply, if one entity is forced to sell its FTT holdings, then the other entity may consequently take a huge hit to its balance sheet\n\\n  Out of the 350 million (m) total supply of FTT, 280m of it was controlled by FTX (~80%) and out of the 59.3m tokens for seed and private rounds, around 27m (or roughly 46%) ended up with Alameda, where almost all the total FTT token supply had to go through Alameda at some point in its distribution. \n\n\n\\\nTherefore, Alameda had a direct role in the development of FTT, and the entities were connected from FTX’s inception.\n\\\nThe initial success of Alameda, FTX, and FTT led to a rise in the value of Alameda’s balance sheet during the 2020-2021 bull market with FTT reaching ATHs in the summer of 2021. \n\\\nThe high value in Alameda’s FTT position was most likely used as collateral by Alameda to borrow from Genesis and other lending desks. \n\\\nAs previously mentioned, the borrowed funds were used to make illiquid investments causing FTT to become a central weakness for Alameda if the price of FTT decreased too much. \n\\\nEffectively, Alameda was in a leveraged long position, where they were borrowing funds using their high-value FTT position that they needed to stay high (long) or else their loans would be recalled.\n\\\nThis strategy worked perfectly in a bull market when prices were at ATHs. \n\\\nBut remember that huge Crypto crash in May/June that caused Terra Luna, 3AC, and a bunch more firms to collapse…. Well right around that time, liquidity quickly started to dry up as borrowing rates & margin calls increased, and creditors started to recall their loans due to general market conditions worsening. \n\\\nGiven that significant portions of Alameda’s balance sheet had consisted of illiquid assets, Alameda was on the brink of a ==liquidity crunch== (in need of cash) as the rest of the Crypto industry was crumbling.\n\\\nDue to the control SBF had over both FTX and Alameda, he knew that if Alameda declared bankruptcy, then an FTT liquidation would occur and cause the price to fall dramatically. \n\\\nWe believe the margin call for Alameda’s FTT position was $22, therefore, if the price of FTT fell below $22 and Alameda did not make payments to meet the margin level, then lending desks would have no option but to sell the FTT collateral. \n\\\nAs a large holder of FTT, FTX would see its FTT holdings crushed. With lending desks like Genesis now recalling their loans to Alameda, SBF decided to send FTX Customer Deposits to Alameda to satisfy their outstanding loan payments. \n\\\nAgain, this was due to Alameda’s illiquid investments in Terra Luna, GBTC, and others. In return for customer deposits, Alameda deposited as much as ~$4 billion worth of FTT on FTX as collateral between early June and July with the majority being sent during the 3AC collapse. \n\\\nSBF was able to move customer deposits without external auditors knowing due to a “Backdoor” software protocol and bespoke accounting practices SBF created in his FTX exchange that would not alert anyone when funds were lent out, like to Alameda.\n\\\nBut why did FTX bail out Voyager and BlockFi during this time? It was because those entities were holding millions of FTT, and other tokens related to FTX. \n\\\nTherefore, if he let those firms go bankrupt, those tokens would have been liquidated and the price of FTT, among others, would decrease and cause FTX to go insolvent. \n\\\nInstead of owning up to their highly leveraged positions and declaring bankruptcy, Alameda and FTX decided to double down and acquire all these firms to stay solvent long enough to make all of the money back. \n\\\nIt solidified FTX’s image as a solvent and responsible institution, which helped FTT's price stay above $22 for the rest of the summer and kept people from digging too much into the two entities.\n\\\nTo reiterate, FTX and Alameda still had leveraged positions outstanding with FTT as the collateral with a margin call of about $22. \n\\\nSBF used customer deposits to cover up the liquidity crunch in the meantime while attempting to make the loss whole with the funds Alameda had available. \n\\\nHowever, Alameda was not able to make up for those losses in time even with the continued help from FTX before the November 2nd article was released. \n\\\nAlthough the November 2nd article exposed Alameda and FTX to the public, it was the ==overleveraged positions== (more debt than collateral), using FTT as collateral, and investments in illiquid and risky tokens that were the true downfall for both firms. \n\\\nHowever, the true contagion started with the GBTC arbitrage trade that 3AC, Alameda, and many other firms participated in during 2020 which was mentioned earlier. \n\\\nThe fallout from these three entities (SBF, FTX, and Alameda) has shaken the Crypto industry and has made long-time enthusiasts question their loyalty to such a selfish industry. \n\\\nMillions of regular people held billions of dollars in FTX as a safe and trusted haven, which SBF took advantage of and used to prop up his own self-esteem.\n\\\nUnlike most other fraudsters who have stayed silent after committing their crime, SBF sought out attention including being interviewed at the New York Times (NYT) Dealbook Conference. \n\\\nHe was asked multiple times during the NYT interview as well as interviews with the Wall Street Journal and Good Morning America if he knew about the misappropriation of Customer Deposits to Alameda which he squeamishly deflected to the excuse that customers with Margin accounts allowed FTX to use their digital assets to lend out to Alameda. \n\\\nEssentially, SBF is making the excuse that somewhere in the Terms of Service it gives FTX the ability to lend out customer digital assets if the customer uses a margin account and that is why customer deposits were sent to Alameda. \n\\\nBut what about the regular customers who never allowed FTX to lend out their digital assets? The Terms of Service, seen below, clearly state that none of the digital assets in a customer’s account are owned or may be loaned out to FTX. \n\\\nThroughout these interviews, he was visibly uncomfortable and tried to answer the interviewer’s questions without actually answering the questions at all. \n\\\nHe has continued to seek attention through interviews, but when the hard questions like, “where did all the money go?” were asked, he bounced around two answers: “I don’t know” and “I don’t know what to say”. \n\\\n@CoffeeZilla, a famous Crypto investigator, had the chance to interview SBF over a Twitter space and drilled SBF on the Terms of Service question. \n\\\nCoffeeZilla was finally able to get SBF to admit that he was treating all customers equally when it comes to withdrawals, even though there were supposed to be two separate pools of funds for regular and margin account customers. \n\\\nTherefore, SBF admitted that FTX was commingling customer funds and was not fulfilling their obligations of the Terms of Service, which is no doubt FRAUD. Why is it fraud? \n\\\nBecause SBF did not follow the Terms of Service that customers agreed to and rather “loaned” (stole) customer digital assets, which they never approved. This is why SBF will go to jail for a very long time.\n\\\n \n\\\nAll I can say is that I am still committed to this technology, and I will keep writing so more people can be informed about the diverse applications of Blockchain. \n\\\nBad actors should not represent our industry when there are thousands of intelligent innovators building sophisticated and beneficial applications for the masses. \n\\\nFor every SBF, there is a Vitalik Buetrin, a Brian Armstrong, a Balaji Srinivasan, and many more lesser-known people fighting for financial freedom. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed it!\n\\\n\n72099.ETH\n\\","dc:creator":"Antonio Verrico","content":"Hedge Funds started using GBTC as a way to arbitrage trade and make a profit.

How did you get started in the tech industry?</strong></h2><div class=\"paragraph\">I started my career in 2004. Believe it or not, my educational background is actually in biotech and engineering rather than business! </div><div class=\"paragraph\">When I began college in 1999, I felt like biotech and medicine would be my future, and I expected to graduate and end up wearing a lab coat and creating things in a lab somewhere. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Life had different plans, though. My first kid was born right before I graduated from college, so, of course, I needed to make money and find something stable. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">I already had some entrepreneurial experience, so I took that and combined it with a side project I had at the time developing websites. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">This was fine as a short-term fix, but I knew it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted to keep doing. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">As I was looking around for system administrator or web developer jobs (again, because they were easy, reliable income), I got an offer from an international company to be their internet marketing manager. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Did I have any experience with that? Absolutely not, but I thought it sounded like an interesting opportunity, so I went for it. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">It turns out that I was good at internet marketing, and I built a network in Europe that let me eventually move on from that global software company to grow my experience. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">In 2010, I moved from internet marketing to the tech startup space. From there, I co-founded two companies, co-owned Russia&#x27;s top e-book store, LitRes, and became CEO of Maps.me, which is what people primarily know me for. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">I&#x27;ve also been involved with a few other tech startups, and I&#x27;m currently the co-founder and CEO of a new basketball training app company called Level Up Basketball.</div><h2><strong>Since Maps.me became so popular under your leadership, let&#x27;s talk about that a little more. What types of problems are you solving with projects like Maps.me?</strong></h2><div class=\"paragraph\">A lot of people don&#x27;t realize that giants like Google Maps don&#x27;t have very up-to-date or complete maps for lesser-traveled regions, and they are expensive for commercial use.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">While it makes sense for there to be a better map of New York City (a densely populated urban area) than, say, a village in Nepal (a small, remote location), it&#x27;s still just as important to have an accurate, complete map for both. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">First responders and humanitarian organizations rely on GPS and map tools to find people who are lost or to undertake search and rescue missions after natural disasters, so these maps can literally be a life-or-death thing. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Here are the problems Maps.me solves: </div><div class=\"paragraph\">First, it puts mapping tools directly into the hands of anyone with a smartphone. Anyone can add or edit map locations and write reviews. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Free, accessible maps are a core tenet of the OpenStreetMap project, which is what Maps.me&#x27;s data is built on. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Second, it creates a fun, rewarding community that encourages users to take charge of mapping out their locations. Nine months after the editor tool was added, over a million edits had already been made across 231 countries. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">The desire to help was there; people just needed an easy tool like Maps.me to make it happen. I like to think of it as &quot;Minecraft for adults,&quot; also serving the greater good. </div><h2><strong>Access to complete, accurate maps is critical and beneficial for the global community. What do you think other businesses and regular internet users can do to address this problem?</strong></h2><div class=\"paragraph\">Yes, these maps are absolutely vital. Without accurate mapping, NGOs have a much harder time coordinating their efforts and aiding those who need it most, and first responders can&#x27;t do their jobs as well or as quickly.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">In 2017, Hurricane Maria was devastating Puerto Rico. The community came together to map the entire area within a week so that emergency teams could find where buildings and other structures had been to help people who were stuck or suffering much faster.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">I think one of the best things companies can do is remove things like copyright barriers and proprietary hardware or software requirements. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">It should be a relatively easy, inexpensive task to access a reliable map, regardless of where you are. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Another thing that would be helpful is more cooperation. OpenStreetMap and Maps.me work so well because people from all over the globe cooperate to help improve the maps. Businesses could learn from this. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">As for users? I think raising awareness that this is an issue would be a helpful step. Most people don&#x27;t think twice about just opening Google Maps to get to their destination; I&#x27;m sure some still don&#x27;t even know an open-source alternative exists. Something else to do would be to make their voices heard on the topic. The internet is great for sparking real change, so I think if more people were vocal about map accessibility, we could see a paradigm shift. </div><h2><strong>You’ve also been working on LitRes, the leading eBook platform in Eastern Europe. What are some important milestones you have reached during your tenure there? How did they affect the company&#x27;s growth</strong>?</h2><div class=\"paragraph\">When I joined LitRes in September 2011, we had a 300k user base, $50k monthly revenue from the website and a marketing team of just 3 people, including myself. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">When I left the company in 2016, we had 23M users (that’s 80x growth!) and $15M annual revenue. That happened mainly to these three innovations:</div><div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>1. An engineering approach to marketing:</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph\">I used the technical department as my resource. It was a unique approach in 2011 that helped to reach a full synergy of technical and marketing departments. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Today we call this kind of top manager - CPO. With this approach, we integrated many marketing technologies into products that helped grow quickly.</div><div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>2. A passionate approach to team building and leadership: </strong></div><div class=\"paragraph\">I always dreamed of building my own marketing team of growth hackers, who will share my passion for great achievements, and I did it. In 2016, the marketing team had already 12 people.</div><div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>3. Strong execution process:</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph\">I worked in several startups before LitRes, where I created my own task management methodology for startups, using Google Sheets as the tool for it. This approach helped to execute everything I implemented in marketing and product.</div><h2><strong>Why was the engineering approach to marketing so important? </strong></h2><div class=\"paragraph\">When you have thousands of titles in your digital catalog, you must have very well-designed pages, folders, categories, and URL structures on the website to fit SEO, SEM, and direct marketing needs.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Good catalog structure helped us to create a unique engine that generated over 5M high-quality ads for Google/Yandex search ads. This business case was highlighted on the Yandex website. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">At the same time, we had a boost in SEO traffic as a result of good structure and focus on UGC, where we incentivized users to leave book reviews.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">In 2012, I initiated a development of four key marketing services needed for fast growth:</div><ul><li>a personal recommendation engine that increased revenue coming from email marketing by up to 18% of the whole company&#x27;s revenue</li><li>an automated high-quality ads generator</li><li>a smart responsive direct marketing platform that could send a smart email to web users, push notifications for mobile users and check each channel&#x27;s health and user satisfaction</li><li>cohort-based traffic attribution system that helped to track each customer acquisition channel separately and reach better LTV/CAC numbers.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph\">Also, I saw great potential in the development of the app for audiobooks. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">We started the development of the app called “Listen!” in March 2012, launched the first version on October 2012, and in January 2013 we hit the top 10 overall grossing in the App Store and Google Play, becoming the #1 app with audiobooks.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">In 2015, the company generated $15M in revenue and became profitable and, soon after that, I decided to leave the company to become the CEO of MAPS.ME and expand my experience on a global scale.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">In 2013-2015, LitRes was #1 by revenue and installs in the non-gaming category in mobile stores in Russia.</div><h2><strong>That’s great.

How did you get started in the tech industry?\nI started my career in 2004. Believe it or not, my educational background is actually in biotech and engineering rather than business! \nWhen I began college in 1999, I felt like biotech and medicine would be my future, and I expected to graduate and end up wearing a lab coat and creating things in a lab somewhere. \nLife had different plans, though. My first kid was born right before I graduated from college, so, of course, I needed to make money and find something stable. \nI already had some entrepreneurial experience, so I took that and combined it with a side project I had at the time developing websites. \nThis was fine as a short-term fix, but I knew it wasn't what I wanted to keep doing. \nAs I was looking around for system administrator or web developer jobs (again, because they were easy, reliable income), I got an offer from an international company to be their internet marketing manager. \nDid I have any experience with that? Absolutely not, but I thought it sounded like an interesting opportunity, so I went for it. \nIt turns out that I was good at internet marketing, and I built a network in Europe that let me eventually move on from that global software company to grow my experience. \nIn 2010, I moved from internet marketing to the tech startup space. From there, I co-founded two companies, co-owned Russia's top e-book store, LitRes, and became CEO of Maps.me, which is what people primarily know me for. \nI've also been involved with a few other tech startups, and I'm currently the co-founder and CEO of a new basketball training app company called Level Up Basketball.\nSince Maps.me became so popular under your leadership, let's talk about that a little more. What types of problems are you solving with projects like Maps.me?\nA lot of people don't realize that giants like Google Maps don't have very up-to-date or complete maps for lesser-traveled regions, and they are expensive for commercial use.\nWhile it makes sense for there to be a better map of New York City (a densely populated urban area) than, say, a village in Nepal (a small, remote location), it's still just as important to have an accurate, complete map for both. \nFirst responders and humanitarian organizations rely on GPS and map tools to find people who are lost or to undertake search and rescue missions after natural disasters, so these maps can literally be a life-or-death thing. \nHere are the problems Maps.me solves: \nFirst, it puts mapping tools directly into the hands of anyone with a smartphone. Anyone can add or edit map locations and write reviews. \nFree, accessible maps are a core tenet of the OpenStreetMap project, which is what Maps.me's data is built on. \nSecond, it creates a fun, rewarding community that encourages users to take charge of mapping out their locations. Nine months after the editor tool was added, over a million edits had already been made across 231 countries. \nThe desire to help was there; people just needed an easy tool like Maps.me to make it happen. I like to think of it as \"Minecraft for adults,\" also serving the greater good. \nAccess to complete, accurate maps is critical and beneficial for the global community. What do you think other businesses and regular internet users can do to address this problem?\nYes, these maps are absolutely vital. Without accurate mapping, NGOs have a much harder time coordinating their efforts and aiding those who need it most, and first responders can't do their jobs as well or as quickly.\nIn 2017, Hurricane Maria was devastating Puerto Rico. The community came together to map the entire area within a week so that emergency teams could find where buildings and other structures had been to help people who were stuck or suffering much faster.\nI think one of the best things companies can do is remove things like copyright barriers and proprietary hardware or software requirements. \nIt should be a relatively easy, inexpensive task to access a reliable map, regardless of where you are. \nAnother thing that would be helpful is more cooperation. OpenStreetMap and Maps.me work so well because people from all over the globe cooperate to help improve the maps. Businesses could learn from this. \nAs for users? I think raising awareness that this is an issue would be a helpful step. Most people don't think twice about just opening Google Maps to get to their destination; I'm sure some still don't even know an open-source alternative exists. Something else to do would be to make their voices heard on the topic. The internet is great for sparking real change, so I think if more people were vocal about map accessibility, we could see a paradigm shift. \nYou’ve also been working on LitRes, the leading eBook platform in Eastern Europe. What are some important milestones you have reached during your tenure there? How did they affect the company's growth?\nWhen I joined LitRes in September 2011, we had a 300k user base, $50k monthly revenue from the website and a marketing team of just 3 people, including myself. \nWhen I left the company in 2016, we had 23M users (that’s 80x growth!) and $15M annual revenue. That happened mainly to these three innovations:\n1. An engineering approach to marketing:\nI used the technical department as my resource. It was a unique approach in 2011 that helped to reach a full synergy of technical and marketing departments. \nToday we call this kind of top manager - CPO. With this approach, we integrated many marketing technologies into products that helped grow quickly.\n2. A passionate approach to team building and leadership: \nI always dreamed of building my own marketing team of growth hackers, who will share my passion for great achievements, and I did it. In 2016, the marketing team had already 12 people.\n3. Strong execution process:\nI worked in several startups before LitRes, where I created my own task management methodology for startups, using Google Sheets as the tool for it. This approach helped to execute everything I implemented in marketing and product.\nWhy was the engineering approach to marketing so important? \nWhen you have thousands of titles in your digital catalog, you must have very well-designed pages, folders, categories, and URL structures on the website to fit SEO, SEM, and direct marketing needs.\nGood catalog structure helped us to create a unique engine that generated over 5M high-quality ads for Google/Yandex search ads. This business case was highlighted on the Yandex website. \nAt the same time, we had a boost in SEO traffic as a result of good structure and focus on UGC, where we incentivized users to leave book reviews.\nIn 2012, I initiated a development of four key marketing services needed for fast growth:\n\na personal recommendation engine that increased revenue coming from email marketing by up to 18% of the whole company's revenue\nan automated high-quality ads generator\na smart responsive direct marketing platform that could send a smart email to web users, push notifications for mobile users and check each channel's health and user satisfaction\ncohort-based traffic attribution system that helped to track each customer acquisition channel separately and reach better LTV/CAC numbers.\n\nAlso, I saw great potential in the development of the app for audiobooks. \nWe started the development of the app called “Listen!” in March 2012, launched the first version on October 2012, and in January 2013 we hit the top 10 overall grossing in the App Store and Google Play, becoming the #1 app with audiobooks.\nIn 2015, the company generated $15M in revenue and became profitable and, soon after that, I decided to leave the company to become the CEO of MAPS.ME and expand my experience on a global scale.\nIn 2013-2015, LitRes was #1 by revenue and installs in the non-gaming category in mobile stores in Russia.\nThat’s great. Let’s now talk about Level Up Basketball, your newest project. Why basketball? What prompted the idea for this company?\nBasketball has been a great love for me since I was a kid. I remember growing up in an area that didn't have much interest in or community around the sport. \nI would have loved to have an online community of people who could help me get better and talk to me about basketball! \nI like being able to leverage all of my experience with community building, app development and analytics to come in and carve out spaces that serve a purpose (mapping, sharing reviews, learning basketball, etc.) but also have a social, gamified element. \nIn these communities, people can share whatever niche passion they have with others who will deeply understand them rather than feeling awkward talking about their interests to real-life friends and family who don't share their passion. \nSo, Level Up Basketball is a true passion project for me. My co-founder is actually the guy I grew up playing basketball with. We would play until it was too dark to see the ball in front of our faces! \nHe has been creating basketball-focused businesses since 2000, so when he came to me for advice about building a project for digitizing the training process, I was immediately all-in. \nI was ready to immediately leverage all of my skills to build something huge that has never really been done before. \nIt’s hard for basketball coaches and amateur players to find a reliable way to source training drills and create community around their love for basketball, which is crazy to me because it’s the number two team sport in the world with huge 450M players!\n\nSure, there are lots of YouTube videos and blogs, but it’s really difficult for people to aggregate the quality videos and tutorials on their own. \nWith Level Up Basketball, we’ve created a single hub for players around the world to access a unique kind of training app that adds features like gamification and “social clout” to make the experience more fun. \nPlayers can earn digital coins that can be used to upgrade their avatars and change their appearance. \nWe’re also planning to connect to the metaverse in the future, allowing players’ avatars to participate in virtual games based on their real-world skills for an even more immersive experience. \nWe’re even working on adding blockchain rewards, which are really appealing to Gen Z.","dc:creator":" Danny Wesley","content":"In this interview we dive into multiple topics, from growing a robust community for a startup in any niche, the power of outsourcing, adapting products to the metaverse, and the future of AI.","contentSnippet":"In this interview we dive into multiple topics, from growing a robust community for a startup in any niche, the power of outsourcing, adapting products to the metaverse, and the future of AI.","guid":"https://hackernoon.com/eugene-lisovskiy-level-up-basket-founder-community-is-the-core-of-everything-it-inspires-growth?source=rss","categories":["community","growth-hacking","metaverse","startups","interview","founders","founder-interview","founder-stories","hackernoon-es","hackernoon-hi","hackernoon-zh","hackernoon-vi","hackernoon-fr","hackernoon-pt","hackernoon-ja"],"isoDate":"2022-12-12T22:48:28.000Z","from":"https://hackernoon.com/feed"},{"creator":"Depth Hoar","title":"EDG Developer Update: Dec 4 - Dec 10, 2022","link":"https://blog.edgewa.re/edg-developer-update-nov-20-2/","pubDate":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 22:48:57 GMT","content:encoded":"<h2 id=\"status-updates\">Status updates </h2><img src=\"https://blog.edgewa.re/content/images/2022/12/dec4.png\" alt=\"EDG Developer Update: Dec 4 - Dec 10, 2022\"><p></p><h3 id=\"all-node-operators-and-validators-are-asked-to-upgrade-their-nodes-to-v402\">All Node operators and Validators are asked to upgrade their nodes to <a href=\"https://github.com/edgeware-network/edgeware-node/releases/tag/v4.0.2\">V4.0.2</a></h3><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDepthHoar\">Depth Hoar</a> </strong>updated the <a href=\"https://escrow-sol.vercel.app/\">Escrow Dapp</a>, so now the IDs match the UI and the actual ID number.

To avoid paying transaction fees, you could sign an off-chain message instead; both Bitcoin and Ethereum have standards for off-chain signed messages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To protect privacy and avoid revealing the entire set of the CEX’s addresses, a zero-knowlege proof can be used to prove ownership of assets. One example is using something like <a href=\"https://github.com/yi-sun/zk-attestor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">zkAttestor</a>. The basic idea is to attest to the ownership of assets against a certain block-header. Efficiency of zkSNARK-based attestation can be improved significantly by batching through proof aggregation (for example, using Halo2).

To avoid paying transaction fees, you could sign an off-chain message instead; both Bitcoin and Ethereum have standards for off-chain signed messages.\nTo protect privacy and avoid revealing the entire set of the CEX’s addresses, a zero-knowlege proof can be used to prove ownership of assets. One example is using something like zkAttestor. The basic idea is to attest to the ownership of assets against a certain block-header. Efficiency of zkSNARK-based attestation can be improved significantly by batching through proof aggregation (for example, using Halo2). There is an ongoing effort from Axiom (with overlapping authors of zkAttestor) working on this problem.\nProof of Liabilities: Existing Solutions\nThe idea behind proof of liabilities is to let the CEX publish a cryptographic accumulator R over the set of liabilities of the exchange (which we call the “liability set”) and a total liability B such that:\nThe accumulator binds to the total liability B, i.e. the exchange cannot change their answer after commiting\nAny user can check that their assets are included in the liability set via a proof that is consistent with the total B and R\n\n\nVitalik provides two protocols that solve this problem, we discuss them below.\nSolution 1: Merkle Sum Tree\n\n\n\nMerkle Sum Tree is a special kind of merkle tree, in which each inner node contains the sum of the balances of its child tree. The great advantage of this scheme is its simplicity (not a bad thing!). In fact, since Vitalik wrote about his design, Mazars already built a proof of liability product for Binance (here). However, as we will articulate next, this solution has devastating privacy leakage.\nSolution 2: KZG - Customized IOP based Sum Proof (KZG-Sum IOP)\nTo improve the privacy and robustness, Vitalik proposed a second scheme[^1] based on KZG and a customized proof system based on an IOP.\n\n\n\nAs shown in the figure above, instead of committing each user’s username and balances in a merkle tree, we can commit a user’s username and balance at adjacent locations in a vector commitment like KZG. Each user only needs to remember her location (in the above example, Charlie’s username is committed in the index 4, his balance is committed in the index 5).\nNext, to prove the summation of the balances, Vitalik proposed a customized IOP-based proof system for efficiency.\nUnlike the Merkle Sum Tree solution, this preserves privacy for the user’s balance.

In the above example, the merkle proof provided to Charlie leaks:\nDavid’s Balance\nThe sum of Alice and Bob’s balance\nThe sum of {Eve, Fred, Greta, Henry}'s balance\nBy creating a number of spam accounts, adversaries can not only gain the information of real users balances, they can also discover the distribution of user’s balances across the CEX. What makes things worse is that this balance information can be correlated with other known infomation (such as on-chain data of token transfers). By correlating the balances, transfers on chain, and balance leakage from MST, many users’ identities can be inferred. This could lead to disastrous privacy concerns for customer data in CEXs.\nWe kill people based on metadata.\nKZG - IOP Sum Solution\nCompared with Merkle Sum Tree, KZG-IOP Sum is a well-balanced solution on a technical level; the major issues are at the practical and engineering level.\nVery Large Trusted Setup\nKZG-IOP Sum solution requires a trusted setup. Some big CEXs could have more than 200 million users. This could translate to more than 400 million elements in the vector commitment. Now, the biggest trusted setup so far (the Perpetual Powers of Tau) has an effective size of 2^{28} \\simeq 270 \\text{ million}. A trusted setup of at least twice this size would be needed.

To avoid paying transaction fees, you could sign an off-chain message instead; both Bitcoin and Ethereum have standards for off-chain signed messages.\nTo protect privacy and avoid revealing the entire set of the CEX’s addresses, a zero-knowlege proof can be used to prove ownership of assets. One example is using something like zkAttestor. The basic idea is to attest to the ownership of assets against a certain block-header. Efficiency of zkSNARK-based attestation can be improved significantly by batching through proof aggregation (for example, using Halo2). There is an ongoing effort from Axiom (with overlapping authors of zkAttestor) working on this problem.\nProof of Liabilities: Existing Solutions\nThe idea behind proof of liabilities is to let the CEX publish a cryptographic accumulator R over the set of liabilities of the exchange (which we call the “liability set”) and a total liability B such that:\nThe accumulator binds to the total liability B, i.e. the exchange cannot change their answer after commiting\nAny user can check that their assets are included in the liability set via a proof that is consistent with the total B and R\n\n\nVitalik provides two protocols that solve this problem, we discuss them below.\nSolution 1: Merkle Sum Tree\n\n\n\nMerkle Sum Tree is a special kind of merkle tree, in which each inner node contains the sum of the balances of its child tree. The great advantage of this scheme is its simplicity (not a bad thing!). In fact, since Vitalik wrote about his design, Mazars already built a proof of liability product for Binance (here). However, as we will articulate next, this solution has devastating privacy leakage.\nSolution 2: KZG - Customized IOP based Sum Proof (KZG-Sum IOP)\nTo improve the privacy and robustness, Vitalik proposed a second scheme[^1] based on KZG and a customized proof system based on an IOP.\n\n\n\nAs shown in the figure above, instead of committing each user’s username and balances in a merkle tree, we can commit a user’s username and balance at adjacent locations in a vector commitment like KZG. Each user only needs to remember her location (in the above example, Charlie’s username is committed in the index 4, his balance is committed in the index 5).\nNext, to prove the summation of the balances, Vitalik proposed a customized IOP-based proof system for efficiency.\nUnlike the Merkle Sum Tree solution, this preserves privacy for the user’s balance. A user doesn’t need anyone else’s balance to attest to the fact that their liability is included.\nProblems with Existing Solutions\nMerkle Sum Tree Solution\nAs mentioned in Vitalik’s blog post, Merkle Sum Tree solution (the one adopted by Binance now) suffers a huge privacy loss for both CEXs and its customers. In more detail:\nWhen a user queries the CEX for a liability proof, the CEX needs to provide a merkle proof containing the balances of other users’ balances along the merkle tree. In the above example, the merkle proof provided to Charlie leaks:\nDavid’s Balance\nThe sum of Alice and Bob’s balance\nThe sum of {Eve, Fred, Greta, Henry}'s balance\nBy creating a number of spam accounts, adversaries can not only gain the information of real users balances, they can also discover the distribution of user’s balances across the CEX. What makes things worse is that this balance information can be correlated with other known infomation (such as on-chain data of token transfers). By correlating the balances, transfers on chain, and balance leakage from MST, many users’ identities can be inferred. This could lead to disastrous privacy concerns for customer data in CEXs.\nWe kill people based on metadata.\nKZG - IOP Sum Solution\nCompared with Merkle Sum Tree, KZG-IOP Sum is a well-balanced solution on a technical level; the major issues are at the practical and engineering level.\nVery Large Trusted Setup\nKZG-IOP Sum solution requires a trusted setup. Some big CEXs could have more than 200 million users. This could translate to more than 400 million elements in the vector commitment. Now, the biggest trusted setup so far (the Perpetual Powers of Tau) has an effective size of 2^{28} \\simeq 270 \\text{ million}. A trusted setup of at least twice this size would be needed. This requires a huge effort and also scarifices on decentralization since the larger the trusted setup size, the higher requirement that it places on the participants.\nRequiring Constructing a New, Customized Proof System\nIn addition, Vitalik’s proposal, while elegant, requires building a customized proof system protocol. When implementing these systems using custom protocols we usually run into three main problems:\nIn practice they are usually not more efficient (potential theoretical performance gain does not align with concrete performance)\nVastly increased code complexity\nReduced modularity with existing codebases and existing proof systems\nHarder to do a good security audit since the auditors are less familiar with these customized constructions\nOur Solution: SNARKed Merkle Sum Proof of Liablities\nWe present below a simple SNARKed Merkle Sum Tree solution that addresses the above problems.
