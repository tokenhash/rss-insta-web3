It describes data or provides additional details about data that makes the original data more functional and provides deeper insight and depth into the utilization of the original data. A primary example of Metadata in blockchain technology is found within the NFT world. NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens utilize Metadata for a variety of purposes, but most notably the key use of Metadata within an NFT is to provide the location of the digital asset to which the NFT is associated. In addition, there is also Metadata that describes the digital asset which provides not only human readable attributes but may also provide programmatic elements that allow the NFT to have enhanced functionality depending upon which NFT standard is being utilized for the NFT. In this regard, there are two distinct types of Metadata defined within an NFT, the first being immutable or permanent contract based Metadata and the second being mutable or changeable Metadata.</p>\n</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fl-module fl-module-heading fl-node-cet9rvn8gq1d\" data-node=\"cet9rvn8gq1d\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module-content fl-node-content\">\n\t\t<h2 class=\"fl-heading\">\n\t\t<span class=\"fl-heading-text\">Immutable Contract Metadata</span>\n\t</h2>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fl-module fl-module-rich-text fl-node-6fi3wh8jco7s\" data-node=\"6fi3wh8jco7s\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module-content fl-node-content\">\n\t\t<div class=\"fl-rich-text\">\n\t<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"609\">When an NFT is minted it creates certain specific data that is immutable and can never be changed. The specific data that is created during the minting process is typically dictated by the NFT standard which is applicable to the NFT being created. An example of this type of data are things such as TokenID, which would represent a globally unique identifier that would be specific to a single NFT. Other immutable attributes might be the Artist’s name, royalty percentage, and so forth. Again this type of data is typically dictated by the NFT standard being utilized to create the NFT.</p>\n</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fl-module fl-module-heading fl-node-2b5nhexjgiuc\" data-node=\"2b5nhexjgiuc\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module-content fl-node-content\">\n\t\t<h2 class=\"fl-heading\">\n\t\t<span class=\"fl-heading-text\">Mutable Contract Metadata</span>\n\t</h2>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fl-module fl-module-rich-text fl-node-3kpvfncxl8qi\" data-node=\"3kpvfncxl8qi\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module-content fl-node-content\">\n\t\t<div class=\"fl-rich-text\">\n\t<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"609\">The more interesting type of Metadata that can be utilized within an NFT is mutable and can be changed as needed.

The most notable and most useful form of Metadata will most likely reside within the actual contract URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), which is typically a JSON file that further expands upon specific items that are useful to the NFT. Utilizing this mechanism within an NFT allows for an almost infinite number of options to provide details and expansion to Metadata whenever the need arises.</p>\n</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fl-module fl-module-heading fl-node-9uphn7s5ejlk\" data-node=\"9uphn7s5ejlk\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module-content fl-node-content\">\n\t\t<h2 class=\"fl-heading\">\n\t\t<span class=\"fl-heading-text\">What is Arweave Metadata?</span>\n\t</h2>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fl-module fl-module-rich-text fl-node-9faxp3sngitu\" data-node=\"9faxp3sngitu\">\n\t<div class=\"fl-module-content fl-node-content\">\n\t\t<div class=\"fl-rich-text\">\n\t<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"609\">Arweave also utilizes Metadata to further help describe and provide additional functionality to data which is stored on the permaweb. In order to utilize Arweave Metadata, the data must first be uploaded or stored onto the permaweb. Although ArDrive can be utilized to view some of this Metadata, it does not currently have the capability to produce Metadata. In order to produce Metadata, one must utilize the Command Line Interface or CLI to upload JSON files that then applies the Metadata to the files that are uploaded. Arweave also contains two different types of Metadata. The first type is known as the MetadataJson, which is a flat structure of data contained within key value pairs that further describe the data or it conforms to a specific schema that will be read by an application.
