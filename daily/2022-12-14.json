的形式存在。这意味着用户实际上可以拥有它们并使用它们与游戏的智能合约进行交互以获得成就和奖励。英雄分为普通、罕见、稀有、史诗和传奇，以及他们的属性、服装等等。</p>\n<p>每个英雄都有自己独特的外观、等级、统计数据和技能。史诗级和传奇级英雄有几率获得“独特技能”。英雄的星级和属性也可以升级。如果英雄拥有魅力属性，则可用于通过“侦察兵”系统招募其他英雄。玩家还可以自定义每个英雄的头发、身体和武器的特定部分，以创建独特的外观。</p>\n<p><img

Line 的 Oozoo 工作室里拥有丰富游戏经验的团队成员，他们专注于 Web3 游戏。</p>\n<p>“我们的目标是吸引那些希望在不牺牲游戏质量的情况下获得更多所有权的传统游戏观众，” Nerdystar 首席执行官 Alan Huh 说。</p>\n<p><img

来增强游戏深度，允许开发者发布可收藏的角色和其他物品以增加游戏的可玩性。LUXON 是韩国 Nerdystar 的心血结晶，Nerdystar 是游戏发行商 Line Games 的新投资部门，该公司是 LINE Corporation 的子公司，是视频游戏发行商和开发商。</p>\n<p>Nerdystar 为其区块链游戏平台 LUXON 获得了 580 万美元的投资，使公司筹集的资金总额达到 1080 万美元。借助 LUXON，Nerdystar 打算通过为传统游戏玩家提供由 NFT 提供支持的高质量游戏，将他们带入 Web3 游戏领域。借助 Line Games 强大的 IP 和游戏组合，Nerdystar 可以迅速将其精心制作的游戏带入 Web3。未来，平台还将吸纳第三方游戏，为用户提供丰富的选择。</p>\n<p><img

LUXON 官方市场出售，赚取收益。不用如 Web2 MMORPG 游戏一般，需要借第三方市场出售虚宝，导致被抽取过高的交易手续费、买家不付款等问题。</p>\n<p>此外，若是在 LUXON 市场交易或参与游戏活动，还可获得英雄价值晶片（Hero Valuechip）、国家价值晶片（Nation Valuechip）NFT。质押这两种晶片 NFT，还可获得 $LXN 奖励，建立 NFT 至 Token 间的可循环经济系统。</p>\n<p><strong>英雄等级与元素</strong></p>\n<p>《Desperado B218》的英雄共分为 5 个星级，英雄有普通的、非凡的、稀有的、史诗的和传奇的。每个英雄会拥有 8

&quot;一个英雄，你需要 2 个有魅力状态的相同等级的英雄，他们会生成一个新的一星英雄。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A57duJqFg-cr9Pys9Eux_.png?height=1184&width=1080\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>2、升星</strong></p>\n<p>星星的数量代表一个英雄的成长潜力。例如，2 星英雄的成长上限要高于 1 星英雄。这意味着，你会希望你的英雄拥有尽可能多的星星。吃掉两个同星级英雄可以让这个英雄升星。</p>\n<p><img

B218 是 LUXON 平台上的第一款游戏，这款游戏是 Line Games 发行的《魅影再临 Exos Heroes》链游版本。这是一款 5v5 的战略团战游戏，在这里，玩家可以召唤英雄，组建强大的阵容并派遣他们出战。该游戏已于 11 月 17 日至 24 日举行封闭 Beta 测试。除此之外，LUXON 已与 DappRadar 合作，给用户空投关键的游戏内 NFT 物品。\n今天就给大家介绍下 Desperado B218 的封测详情，感兴趣的朋友可以了解下，还可以参加现在的官方活动，获取不久后的内测资格！\n✨文章末尾还有苍耳小姐的游戏介绍视频，感兴趣的朋友可以点击查看～\n\n项目信息\n👾游戏名称｜Desperado B218\n🪙Token名称｜$LXN、$BT\n🔗支持的区块链｜Polygon\n🖥支持的客户端｜PC端\nDesperado B218官网：https://desperado.games\nDesperado B218推特: https://twitter.com/desperadob218\nDiscord官方社区：http://discord.gg/invite/Htb2cAcHbF\n项目简介\nDESPERADO B218 是一款五对五的战略团队游戏。在这里，玩家可以招募英雄，组成强大的阵容，并派遣他们进行战斗。此外，玩家可以使用英雄来帮助他人，与其他玩家竞争，并向队友请求帮助。\n在 DESPERADO B218 中，英雄是游戏中重要的角色和资产，以 NFT 的形式存在。这意味着用户实际上可以拥有它们并使用它们与游戏的智能合约进行交互以获得成就和奖励。英雄分为普通、罕见、稀有、史诗和传奇，以及他们的属性、服装等等。\n每个英雄都有自己独特的外观、等级、统计数据和技能。史诗级和传奇级英雄有几率获得“独特技能”。英雄的星级和属性也可以升级。如果英雄拥有魅力属性，则可用于通过“侦察兵”系统招募其他英雄。玩家还可以自定义每个英雄的头发、身体和武器的特定部分，以创建独特的外观。\n\n团队信息\n制作公司 Nerdystar 表示，其有 100 名开发人员和艺术家，其中大多数是来自 Line 的 Oozoo 工作室里拥有丰富游戏经验的团队成员，他们专注于 Web3 游戏。\n“我们的目标是吸引那些希望在不牺牲游戏质量的情况下获得更多所有权的传统游戏观众，” Nerdystar 首席执行官 Alan Huh 说。\n\n合作伙伴\nLUXON 是一个由 Polygon 驱动的游戏平台。它帮助游戏利用 NFT 来增强游戏深度，允许开发者发布可收藏的角色和其他物品以增加游戏的可玩性。LUXON 是韩国 Nerdystar 的心血结晶，Nerdystar 是游戏发行商 Line Games 的新投资部门，该公司是 LINE Corporation 的子公司，是视频游戏发行商和开发商。\nNerdystar 为其区块链游戏平台 LUXON 获得了 580 万美元的投资，使公司筹集的资金总额达到 1080 万美元。借助 LUXON，Nerdystar 打算通过为传统游戏玩家提供由 NFT 提供支持的高质量游戏，将他们带入 Web3 游戏领域。借助 Line Games 强大的 IP 和游戏组合，Nerdystar 可以迅速将其精心制作的游戏带入 Web3。未来，平台还将吸纳第三方游戏，为用户提供丰富的选择。\n\n封测详情\nGWG 小姐姐有幸参加了 DESPERADO B218 刚结束的封闭内测，接下来简单介绍一下封测的经历吧！\n\n游戏从一开场就非常华丽，在一阵璀璨的光效过后，我们来到了游戏的大厅，在这里，你还可以看见其他的玩家，以及各种各样的英雄。\n\n点击右下角管理英雄，可以看到英雄的属性、技能甚至人物故事。\n\n右下角第二个按钮则是管理队伍，你可以使用系统推荐的搭配，也可以按照自己的想法自由搭配英雄。\n\n右上角的商店，则可以使用排行榜的积分购买各种各样所需的材料。\n\n 点击右下角的匹配即可进入竞技场。\n\n战斗为回合制，每个英雄头上都有相应的血条，血条为零时会倒下，将敌方的五个英雄全部击倒则获得胜利。\n\n英雄们的技能和配音都非常地华丽和帅气，单凭图片展示不出来，大家还是看看文章末尾的视频介绍吧！\n\n英雄 NFT\n英雄是游戏中的重要角色和资产，以 NFT 的形式存在。这意味着，用户可以实际拥有他们，并使用他们与游戏的智能合约互动，以获得成就和奖励。\n为了贯彻赋予玩家所有权的特色，在《Desperado B218》中的英雄角色，都将化身为可持有的 NFT。并且在培养所持 NFT 后，还可以透过 LUXON 官方市场出售，赚取收益。不用如 Web2 MMORPG 游戏一般，需要借第三方市场出售虚宝，导致被抽取过高的交易手续费、买家不付款等问题。\n此外，若是在 LUXON 市场交易或参与游戏活动，还可获得英雄价值晶片（Hero Valuechip）、国家价值晶片（Nation Valuechip）NFT。质押这两种晶片 NFT，还可获得 $LXN 奖励，建立 NFT 至 Token 间的可循环经济系统。\n英雄等级与元素\n《Desperado B218》的英雄共分为 5 个星级，英雄有普通的、非凡的、稀有的、史诗的和传奇的。每个英雄会拥有 8 个属性值：攻击、防御、健康（血条）、命中率、闪避能力、爆击伤害、效果抵抗能力与攻击速度。\n另有两种能力与属性为随机值：\n技能：英雄会拥有随机 1 个被动技、0 至 1 个主动技，而传奇、史等级英雄会拥有专属技能。\n魅力值：代表英雄的类别，会决定英雄可繁殖的次数。若魅力值为零，则该英雄将无法繁殖。\n\n目前，用户可以通过参与初始空投来获得这些英雄。之后，用户必须从 LUXON 商店购买英雄招募券来获得英雄。或者，你可以在 LUXON 市场上与其他用户交易来获得它们。\n\n守护石：共有 6 大元素（火、冰、自然、机械、光、暗），每位英雄角色将拥有 1 个守护石。当战败时，英雄会受到惩罚（效果未定）。\n支援队伍：在编队时带上相同元素、国家或职业的英雄，可以获得 1 个 Buff。\n地图：在 Lenombe 帝国出生的英雄，可在 Lenombe 地图获得属性加成，等于获得主场优势。《Desperado B218》中共有 4 个国家：Lenombe、Brunn、Saint West  与  The Rebels。\n职业：根据职业不同，英雄的预设状态也会不同。《Desperado B218》中共有 10 种角色：守护者、骑士、圣骑士、魔法师、牧师、战士、巫师、游侠、刺客与诡术师。\n让英雄变强\n为了赢得战斗，你需要更强大的英雄，在 Desperado B218 中，有 3 种方法可以使你的英雄更强大。\n1、侦察（其实就是生孩子）\n要 \"侦察 \"一个英雄，你需要 2 个有魅力状态的相同等级的英雄，他们会生成一个新的一星英雄。\n\n2、升星\n星星的数量代表一个英雄的成长潜力。例如，2 星英雄的成长上限要高于 1 星英雄。这意味着，你会希望你的英雄拥有尽可能多的星星。吃掉两个同星级英雄可以让这个英雄升星。\n\n3、提升属性\n状态代表你的英雄有多强。很明显，拥有较高属性的英雄有更好的机会赢得战斗。五星英雄通过吃掉一个五星英雄（只有五星才可以）可以获得更高的属性。\n\n纪念水晶 NFTs\nExos Heros 由 Line Games 在多个平台发布，包括 Steam、Android、iOS 和 Floor（Line Games自己的平台）。该游戏最近发布了纪念水晶 NFTs，在 LUXON 生态系统和 DESPERADO B218 中具有长期价值。\n\n用户可以入股纪念水晶 NFT 并获得奖励。周期性地，平衡 Token 将被分配给押注纪念水晶的账户。然后用户可以花费这些 Token 来兑换 DESPERADO B218 的游戏资源。\n玩家拥有了这些纪念水晶，就可以获得 \"du注奖励\"，基本上相当于储蓄账户的利息，甚至是股票红利。定期，\"余额 Token\"将作为 \"du注奖励 \"的奖励发放--然后这些可以用来兑换游戏中的物品，包括货币和 DESPERADO B218 的成长材料。\n\"LUXON 绝不会强迫你拥有一个你不想要的角色。无论你想专注于游戏、交易还是投资，选择权在你手中。当然，你也可以参与上述所有的角色，\"\n游戏的官方指南说。\n\"你，作为用户，将决定 DESPERADO B218 的路线图。决定 DESPERADO B218 的扩展的关键要素，如对某个英雄的能力叠加 BUFF，将通过 LUXON 的 DAO 决定。\"\n经济模型\nLUXON 具有 $LXN 和余额 Token $BT 的双 Token 经济。LXN 是一种实用 Token，用户可以用它来购买商店里的物品，在市场上交易等。BT 是治理 Token，促进了 LUXON 的 DAO 的运作。用户可以通过押注水晶、消费或持有 LXN 获得 BT。\n随着项目的发展，LUXON 团队和社区将为两种 Token 引入更多的使用案例。\n在《Desperado B218》中使用的 Token 主要有二：$LXN、Balance Tokens ($BT)。\n1、$LXN 是 LUXON 的实用 Token，除了可直接购买外，还可透过质押价值晶片（Valuechip）的方式取得。不过，在 $LXN 上市前，商店与市场上的 $LXN 交易，暂定改为用 $MATIC（Polygon 原生 Token）支付。\n2、Balance Token 是 LUXON DAO（去中心化组织）的治理 Token，可在 LUXON 平台购买，或透过游戏奖励、质押等方式取得。\n\n游戏体验心得\n🌟Luxon 的《Desperado B218》是一款非常优秀的游戏，它的美术风格和剧情都非常出色，体验起来也很流畅，它还引入了区块链 NFT 系统，让玩家能够拥有自己的角色，并获得经济利益，为玩家提供了更多的选择。\n👀在游戏质量和发布速度方面，《Desperado

</p>\n<p><strong>（1）经济周期引发的熊市</strong></p>\n<p>即经济过热，美联储不得不加息抑制经济，因此造成股市下跌。</p>\n<p>这些熊市包括66/70/74/82/84/90/02年。</p>\n<p><strong>（2）黑天鹅引发的熊市</strong></p>\n<p>即突如其来的外因导致的股市下跌。 </p>\n<p>比如典型的 01年911 ，（前几天看《财阀家的小儿子》还专门看了这段行情），08年的次贷危机， 20 年的疫情。</p>\n<p>对于美联储而言， 不同类型的熊市 ，政策是完全不同的。 </p>\n<p><strong>在经济周期引发的熊市中，</strong>往往都是美联储先加息——股市下跌——转向开始减息后——市场反弹。 </p>\n<p><strong>但在黑天鹅引发的熊市中，</strong>美联储基本直接开始减息，但因为外因太突然，往往无法阻止股市下跌，需要一段时间的市场消化，等待降息快要结束或者结束了时间，股市才会反弹。</p>\n<p><strong>那我们目前属于哪种情况呢？</strong></p>\n<p>在过去的九个月里，鲍威尔以 1980 年代以来所有美联储主席中最快的速度加息，引发了市场崩溃，使房地产市场陷入停滞，并引发了人们对即将到来的经济衰退的担忧。 所以我们目前属于经济过热 伴随着通胀，然后美联储加息，引发衰退担忧。 那其实现在就属于第一种，经济周期引发的熊市。</p>\n<p><strong>那按照过去的历史规律，往往降息后开始反弹。</strong></p>\n<p>昨天公布了CPI

停止减息等关键时间点后会有啥走势？\n希望可以给大家一些启发和帮助。\n\n上图是桥水对美联储政策对于历次熊市影响的研究，图中展示的是过去60 年美股跌超10% 的情况，每次V 字形都是股市的一次下跌和反弹，红色的部分就是美联储降息的周期。\n熊市，分为2大类型 \n（1）经济周期引发的熊市\n即经济过热，美联储不得不加息抑制经济，因此造成股市下跌。\n这些熊市包括66/70/74/82/84/90/02年。\n（2）黑天鹅引发的熊市\n即突如其来的外因导致的股市下跌。 \n比如典型的 01年911 ，（前几天看《财阀家的小儿子》还专门看了这段行情），08年的次贷危机， 20 年的疫情。\n对于美联储而言， 不同类型的熊市 ，政策是完全不同的。 \n在经济周期引发的熊市中，往往都是美联储先加息——股市下跌——转向开始减息后——市场反弹。 \n但在黑天鹅引发的熊市中，美联储基本直接开始减息，但因为外因太突然，往往无法阻止股市下跌，需要一段时间的市场消化，等待降息快要结束或者结束了时间，股市才会反弹。\n那我们目前属于哪种情况呢？\n在过去的九个月里，鲍威尔以 1980 年代以来所有美联储主席中最快的速度加息，引发了市场崩溃，使房地产市场陷入停滞，并引发了人们对即将到来的经济衰退的担忧。 所以我们目前属于经济过热 伴随着通胀，然后美联储加息，引发衰退担忧。 那其实现在就属于第一种，经济周期引发的熊市。\n那按照过去的历史规律，往往降息后开始反弹。\n昨天公布了CPI ，美国11月CPI同比7.1%，预估为7.3%，前值为7.7%；核心CPI同比6%，预期6.1%，前值6.3%； 目前CPI 数据再次超预期回落，确认了通胀的拐点， 那概率明年Q4季度应该会回到2-3% 左右，靠近美联储的目标值。\n根据最新联邦利率期货数据，市场预计美联储的加息终点将是4.8%，并在9月或10月开启降息，并在年底降至4.2%。\n不过关于利率将加到「多高」，并维持「多久」，这个问题大概率将在明天天凌晨3点给出答案。\n\n所以目前最坏的情况已经过去 ，之前在通胀文章就提过，本次通胀就是由于疫情过于宽松的货币政策导致的，而这要更容易被紧缩的货币政策解决， 鲍威尔以 1980 年代以来所有美联储主席中最快的速度加息 和缩表 ，目前的情况也证明这一点。\n加上上次分析的在 3个月预计 就业问题会转机， 那本次情况可能会比以往熊市所体现的规律更提前一些，那可能在减息前就开始反弹。 反正目前情况已经不可能更糟了，黎明前的黑暗而已。\nIf you find submirror valuable, please consider donate to wong2.eth to

id=\"01-web2-公司探索-nft-之路\">01 Web2 公司探索 NFT 之路</h2>\n<p>过去一年传统公司尤其是互联网企业纷纷开始 Web3 之路的尝试，对于巨头们来说，兼具流量与品牌效应的 NFT 成为了首选。以下梳理几家中外传统企业在 NFT 上的探索之路。</p>\n<h3 id=\"reddit-社区：cryptosnoos-nft-系列\">Reddit 社区：CryptoSnoos NFT 系列</h3>\n<p>Reddit 是一个综合性的社交媒体平台，用户可以在上面发帖参与任何感兴趣的内容，相当于美版天涯与贴吧，目前拥有 15 亿注册用户，月活 4.3 亿，日活5200 万，是全美排名前五的社交网站。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a3d862eb5f5f71baf18e4a18a370be31dfeceee29bff4338fea2d77b1bb6320e/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6a7632397667472e6a7067\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>早在 2013 年，Reddit 与加密世界就已结缘。彼时其联合创始人 Alexis Ohanian 参与了 Coinbase 的天使轮投资，网站的付费服务也率先支持比特币付款，2014 年时还曾计划推出自己的加密货币 Reddit Notes。除了 Token，Reddit 在 NFT 上也有动作。Reddit NFT 的理念同样来自 Alexis Ohanian，他在一次大学讲堂中表达了自己对自家 NFT 的理念——发现与探索人类。首批 NFT CryptoSnoos 于 2021 年 6 月发行，只有 4 个。今年 8 月，Reddit 与 Polygon 合作，推出了CryptoSnoos NFT 的升级版，受到空前关注。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d97ad80f6ec2a9356246692e1a4e71e97173274abac47c7e9b53e6eb44724580/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f384a577175356e2e706e67\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Reddit 的早期 NFT 主要由艺术家设计，为了利用 NFT 更好的实现去中心化与社区自治，后期则慢慢变为由用户根据自己的喜好进行个性化定制。免费 NFT 获取非常简单，用户满足活跃度等条件即可进入商店自由搭配，生成自己喜欢的风格。此举也成功为加密世界带来了大量新用户。根据链上 <a href=\"https://dune.com/dunetester/reddit-avatar-nft-holder-stats\">DUNE @dunetester</a> 统计，截至今天，Reddit 的免费 NFT 共有约 375 万个，由大约 373 万个独立地址持有，而付费系列共有 44595 个，由 17511 个独立地址持有。</p>\n<p>Reddit NFT 火爆原因可以归为以下三点：</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>空投范围广，地板便宜，获取简单；</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>降低新人进入加密世界门槛。Reddit 设计了非常好的新人使用流程，mint/购买 NFT 犹如 Web2 操作一样简单。例如在钱包创建中，Reddit 使用了基于 Polygon 的托管钱包 Vault，用户不必切换第三方注册，不必记忆助记词，甚至 GAS FEE 也由 Reddit 支付。而 Vault 使用也很简单，只有移动端，与 Reddit 互通。因此整套注册使用流程跟 Web2 无异。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Reddit 社区活跃，创始人主动带领平台向去中心化社群发展。用户地位来自于平台互动与成员认可，引入 NFT 则加深了对用户个性化、稀缺性的追求。</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"百度：dudu-nft-系列\">百度：DuDu NFT 系列</h3>\n<p>百度是中国最大的提供搜索引擎服务的互联网公司。早先与阿里巴巴、腾讯并称 BAT——中国互联网三巨头。但在市值破千亿后，百度服务趋于闭环变现、均质化布局，伴随一系列发展问题被同行大幅超越。目前百度 AI 平台与自动驾驶逐渐起步，在内容上的积累也显示出护城河优势，综合实力来看，仍然是国内排名前七的互联网公司。</p>\n<p><strong>数藏</strong></p>\n<p>不同于国外公链环境，国内公司多选择数字藏品，或是开发在宣传中强调面向海外用户的公链 NFT 来规避可能的政策风险。但是百度也没有在数藏领域有大的动作，事实上无论是数藏还是公链 NFT，百度基本只负责销售，鲜少参与作品创作。数藏方面，百度曾经推出过三个平台，各个平台所发售的藏品各不相同，但整体与其他平台藏品无异，目前剩两个平台还在运营。</p>\n<p><strong>发行</strong></p>\n<p>NFT 方面，今年 8 月百度国际化事业部旗下的海外输入法 Simeji 与日本游戏开发商 ITI 合作共同发售 CryptoSimeji NFT。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6f5bb1ce345e05627eb2b233824c533316d61ac8ab5175c44e841f40b2eabb17/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6e5062767347392e706e67\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Simeji 作为日本下载量最高的手机输入法，在日本拥有超高人气，同时也是世界最大的颜文字社区。CryptoSimeji NFT 画风以 Simeji 品牌 Logo 为主，整体为小蘑菇像素风，有趣呆萌，加上之前有传言与ITI的合作除了NFT，还会有NFT衍生游戏，吸引了众多粉丝参与，Opensea 日榜冲到第四。小蘑菇总发行量 10000 个，团队自留 300。目前地板 0.075 ETH，最高为0.4ETH，总成交量 2671 ETH。</p>\n<p>小蘑菇路线图并未公布，官网给出 type to earn 玩法，但是目前只有第一阶段钻石手奖励，根据持有人的 NFT 持有数量及时间计算积分，瓜分总量20ETH 的奖池。小蘑菇整体属于小而美的项目，本身也是 Freemint，所以目前这个成绩表现良好。但是项目开图后，基本再无后续动作，所以地板止步0.4ETH，比较可惜。</p>\n<p><strong>DuDuLab Project</strong></p>\n<p>不同于 CryptoSimeji NFT ，百度在其第二个 NFT 项目 DuDuLab Project 中亲力亲为，项目设计、开发、运营计划等全由百度团队独立完成。NFT 主体形象也用上了百度第一大 IP——小度熊。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0abe98d1f993d080a70b27edb3a3bde0d512fc4d100e260906f65aa9201622a0/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4236746358394b2e6a7067\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>百度对 DuDu 熊期望非常高，除了 IP 使用，更是投入 AI 技术作为项目核心。项目方将 DuDu 熊的经历设计为一部百万字的长篇小说，NFT 持有人参与共创，整部小说中的插画设计、宣发文案等也有 AIGC 身影。甚至在第二批空投中决定完全由 AI 生成 NFT，实现 AI 与 NFT 相结合。这种社群参与互动的方式其实更接近 WEB3 社群，百度希望以共创的方式与持有人及社群成员慢慢建立共识，从而讲出自己的故事。</p>\n<p>DuDu Lab 第一期发行总量 10000 个，地板最高 0.09ETH，目前0.042ETH，交易量 478ETH。后续持有者权益还将包括官方文创商品、品牌合作资源、二期 NFT 空投等。DuDu 熊本身资源配置不错，但是叙事对于熊市有些审美疲劳，地板价在mint初期遭纸手大量出货后，基本再无变化。</p>\n<h3 id=\"哔哩哔哩：数藏平台和-cheers-up-nft-系列\">哔哩哔哩：数藏平台和 Cheers UP NFT 系列</h3>\n<p>哔哩哔哩简称 B 站，是位于中国上海的一家以 ACG 内容起家的弹幕视频分享网站。经过 13 年发展，已成长为中国年轻世代高度聚集的综合性视频社区。目前用户数 3.1 亿，月活达 2.93 亿，日活 8350 万，其中 35 岁以下用户占比超过 86%，24 岁以下超过 75%。日均使用时长更是达到了 82 分钟。</p>\n<p>围绕用户、创作者和内容，B 站构建了一个源源不断产生优质内容的生态系统，涵盖生活、游戏、时尚、知识、音乐等数千个品类和圈层，引领着流行文化的风潮，成为中文互联网极其独特的存在。目前，B 站 94% 的视频播放量都来自于专业用户创作的视频。在此基础之上，B 站提供了游戏、直播、付费内容、广告、漫画、电商等商业化产品服务，并对电竞、虚拟偶像等前沿领域展开战略布局。数字藏品也是其中之一。</p>\n<p>可能是熟悉年轻文化与创意市场，B 站的数藏跟 NFT 之路都走的非常顺畅。今年 1 月，B 站首款数藏头像“鸽德”上线，全网限量 2233 个，仅面向每日登陆的 6 级用户，其中 233 个由平台分给了部分知名 UP 主。4 月国内数藏行业合规提上日程后，其他平台纷纷遇冷，但 B 站仍然较为激进，在开放了 30 天免费转赠后，<strong>鸽德藏品</strong>价格一路走高，部分稀有属性更是达到万元以上。到了 7 月 B 站开始大量上新。根据 B 站数藏发售公告显示，8 月之前只有 15 款数藏作品，而截止 12 月 8 日，B 站总共发行数字藏品 42 款。频繁上新之下报名申购依然火爆。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0feecc3f7e21622ae8e6bf54d212635ce037659f49fad8ced3196422f409d04b/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f504d794251777a2e706e67\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>总结 B 站数藏成功原因有以下几点：</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>差异化内容。各大平台数藏作品多集中在复刻古玩、名画品类，B 站数藏内容与其他平台有较为明显区别，自身二次元文化出发的数藏作品更加契合 B 站年轻用户。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>联动平台原生内容与 IP。例如鸽德藏品支持衍生品制作与线上二次创作，之后的绝大部分藏品除了数字头像本体外，还附带空间页交互视频与高清版权视频，同样支持二创与授权服务，全面助力优质内容推广。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>高使用场景。B 站数藏入口内置于 APP 中，自带的社交属性更易发挥数藏的稀缺性。除了头像本身的观赏属性，B站还为持有者增加了双击特效、直播礼物、特殊弹幕样式等个性化场景，增加趣味性的同时还增加了使用价值。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>30 天转赠时间。相比其他平台，较短的转赠与冷却时间无疑成为热度推动的助力一击。</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>总体来看，虽然目前国内还存在版权、交易管理等问题，但 B 站数藏在内容、场景、价值上都走出了一条不一样的健康发展道路。</p>\n<p>NFT 方面，B 站在 4 月授权 Base Labs 向海外用户发行了“Cheers UP”系列 NFT，原定总量 10000 个，发行后实际 Mint 4526 个，后经Holders 投票决定销毁 5000 个，无公售及空投。cheers UP 国库预留241 个，Base Labs 团队预留 223 个。整体以<strong>验资抽奖</strong>形式发白，售价 0.12ETH。Cheers UP 采用双合约机制，根据是否开图分为 Cheers UP Period 及 Cheers UP Official，是否开图由持有者决定。NFT 形象来自 B 站社区文化“Bilibili 干杯”。</p>\n<p><img

alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>除了上述提到的开盲盒，Cheers UP 还有一些别的有趣玩法。例如酿造/质押系统。持有人可以在官网通过酿造或质押获得累积积分 Z（开盒后为酿造功能，未开的盲盒提供对应质押功能），目前酿造每天 1 分，积分可以在商城中换取奖励。值得一提的是除了手机壳、礼盒等实物奖品外，还有 B 站大会员兑换卡。大会员是 B 站推出的付费会员机制，开通后可以解锁付费内容、4K 清晰度等。也可以选择兑换 Cheers UP NFT 盲盒。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5c405f1e12862bcb2c98e7173a68940f7c212d7c15578ce50d017f205b9f0836/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f706a52437856392e6a7067\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>目前除了 Cheers UP NFT，B 站还发行了 Cheers up 表情包系列 NFT、干杯节 NFT 纪念徽章。Cheers UP 系列地板最高 1.15ETH，盲盒目前0.78ETH，交易量 2025ETH；已开图系列地板 0.529ETH，交易量 1040ETH。</p>\n<p>总体来看，Cheers UP 系列属于比较有诚意的，团队表现中规中矩，在初期 Mint 危机时表现出色，销毁使地板大涨 3 倍，但后期宣发较为停滞，未能走出国人圈子。期待下一个牛市可以晋级国产 NFT 之光。</p>\n<h2 id=\"02-ape-和-link-质押背景、现状\">02 APE 和 LINK 质押背景、现状</h2>\n<p>近期 Apecoin 和 Chainlink 均推出了代币质押。截止 12 月 13 日，据 ApeCoin 官方质押数据显示，APE 质押量已经突破 7000 万枚，价值逾 3 亿美元。而 Chainlink 社区质押池共 2250 枚 LINK 的额度也已经满额。下面将分别介绍 APE 和 LINK 质押背景、现状。</p>\n<h3 id=\"apecoin-质押\">Apecoin 质押</h3>\n<p>APE 质押系统于 12 月 5 日上线，同时也正式开启为期一周的 Ape Staking 预质押阶段。Ape 代币质押激励从 12 月 12 日开启发放，基于 12 月 8 日预质押的数据，预期 APY 收益为 1000%+。</p>\n<p>据 Lookonchain 12 月 12 日 监测数据显示， APE 质押数量前三名均为 ApeCoin 基金会地址，共计质押 1220 万枚APE（约5160万美元）。第四名质押了约 145 万枚APE（约 615 万美元），第五名则质押了约 120 万枚APE（约 509 万美元）。</p>\n<p>据 Lookonchain 12 月 12 日 监测数据显示， APE 质押数量前三名均为 ApeCoin 基金会地址，共计质押 1220 万枚APE（约5160万美元），除此之外的第四名质押了约 145 万枚APE（约 615 万美元），第五名则质押了约 120 万枚APE（约 509 万美元）。</p>\n<p><strong>ApeCoin 质押机制</strong></p>\n<p>APE 质押系统有 4 个代币池，每个代币池的质押规则和奖励不同：</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>ApeCoin 池：该矿池不要求用户持有NFT，任何 APE 代币持有者都可以向该矿池存入尽可能多的 APE 代币。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>BAYC 池：该矿池要求用户持有一只 Bored Ape 才能参与其中。在 BAYC 池中，用户最多可以为他们持有的每个 Bored APE 存入 10,094 枚 APE 代币。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>MAYC 池：该池要求用户持有一只Mutant Ape 才能参与其中。在MAYC 池中，用户最多可以为他们持有的每个Mutant Ape 存入2, 042 枚APE。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>BAKC + BAYC 或 MAYC：该池不同于 BAYC 和 MAYC 池，用户不仅需要拥有一只 Bored Ape 或 Mutant Ape，还需要拥有一只 Bored Ape Kennel Club Dog，满足条件的用户可以为他们持有的每个 Bored Ape/Mutant Ape 和 BAKC Dog 存入最多 856 枚APE。</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>以上 4 种代币池的奖励分配，将依据上一年 Q4 的 NFT 价格决定。其中，ApeCoin 池将固定分配当年总奖励池的 30% ，其余 3 个则随后续 NFT 价格浮动，NFT 价格越高，质押池对应的 APE 分配比率越高。</p>\n<p><strong>参与 APE 质押的几种途径</strong></p>\n<p>JamesX（@0xJamesXXX） 梳理了目前能参与 APE 质押活动的 4 个途径：</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>ApeStake.io 官方质押 在 ApeStake 中的质押权益是绑定于 NFT 的，如要售卖 NFT，需要先解除绑定和质押。否则 NFT 卖出后，质押收益将属于买方。 官方质押平台 ApeStake.io 上有质押状态查询工具，输入 NFT 的 ID 或钱包地址，便可查看相关 NFT 是否正使用质押功能，并显示质押的数量。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ParaSpace：NFT 抵押借贷并进行质押 ParaSpace 以 NFT 抵押借贷作为平台的基础逻辑，配合 Ape Staking 的机制，让 NFT 的持有者可以通过抵押借贷获得额外流动性资金，参与 Ape Staking 流动性挖矿从而持续获得 APE 代币挖矿奖励。ParaSpace 在智能合约中规避了官方质押存在的“直接卖出 NFT 损失质押收益”的问题。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>BendDAO：P2P 撮合 NFT 与 $APE 质押 NFT 持有者只需要质押 NFT 并设置好参与 APE Staking 质押收益的分成比率，等待与 APE 代币持有者配对后即可参与 APE Staking。APE 代币持有者则可以选择任意一个 Ape NFT 配对进行质押。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Binance NFT：中心化匹配 NFT 和 $APE 质押 APE 代币持有者可以在 Staking 页面进行质押，NFT 持有者可以在 Binance NFT 平台质押 NFT，无需相应的 APE 代币配对质押。Binance 相当于为 Ape NFT 的持有者提供了一个中心化的质押服务。</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"chainlink-质押\">Chainlink 质押</h3>\n<p>Chainlink 近期在其主办的 SmartCon 大会上介绍了过去一年中的重大研究成果，Chainlink Economics 2.0 预计会在今年 12 月份上线，Chainlink Economics 2.0 旨在提高数据安全性和实用性，同时降低预言机服务的运营成本，增加支付给 Chainlink

嗷嗷#8854 Twitter： @linyao1900 @Guaaronnnn @shenyc\n01 Web2 公司探索 NFT 之路\n过去一年传统公司尤其是互联网企业纷纷开始 Web3 之路的尝试，对于巨头们来说，兼具流量与品牌效应的 NFT 成为了首选。以下梳理几家中外传统企业在 NFT 上的探索之路。\nReddit 社区：CryptoSnoos NFT 系列\nReddit 是一个综合性的社交媒体平台，用户可以在上面发帖参与任何感兴趣的内容，相当于美版天涯与贴吧，目前拥有 15 亿注册用户，月活 4.3 亿，日活5200 万，是全美排名前五的社交网站。\n\n早在 2013 年，Reddit 与加密世界就已结缘。彼时其联合创始人 Alexis Ohanian 参与了 Coinbase 的天使轮投资，网站的付费服务也率先支持比特币付款，2014 年时还曾计划推出自己的加密货币 Reddit Notes。除了 Token，Reddit 在 NFT 上也有动作。Reddit NFT 的理念同样来自 Alexis Ohanian，他在一次大学讲堂中表达了自己对自家 NFT 的理念——发现与探索人类。首批 NFT CryptoSnoos 于 2021 年 6 月发行，只有 4 个。今年 8 月，Reddit 与 Polygon 合作，推出了CryptoSnoos NFT 的升级版，受到空前关注。\n\nReddit 的早期 NFT 主要由艺术家设计，为了利用 NFT 更好的实现去中心化与社区自治，后期则慢慢变为由用户根据自己的喜好进行个性化定制。免费 NFT 获取非常简单，用户满足活跃度等条件即可进入商店自由搭配，生成自己喜欢的风格。此举也成功为加密世界带来了大量新用户。根据链上 DUNE @dunetester 统计，截至今天，Reddit 的免费 NFT 共有约 375 万个，由大约 373 万个独立地址持有，而付费系列共有 44595 个，由 17511 个独立地址持有。\nReddit NFT 火爆原因可以归为以下三点：\n空投范围广，地板便宜，获取简单；\n降低新人进入加密世界门槛。Reddit 设计了非常好的新人使用流程，mint/购买 NFT 犹如 Web2 操作一样简单。例如在钱包创建中，Reddit 使用了基于 Polygon 的托管钱包 Vault，用户不必切换第三方注册，不必记忆助记词，甚至 GAS FEE 也由 Reddit 支付。而 Vault 使用也很简单，只有移动端，与 Reddit 互通。因此整套注册使用流程跟 Web2 无异。\nReddit 社区活跃，创始人主动带领平台向去中心化社群发展。用户地位来自于平台互动与成员认可，引入 NFT 则加深了对用户个性化、稀缺性的追求。\n百度：DuDu NFT 系列\n百度是中国最大的提供搜索引擎服务的互联网公司。早先与阿里巴巴、腾讯并称 BAT——中国互联网三巨头。但在市值破千亿后，百度服务趋于闭环变现、均质化布局，伴随一系列发展问题被同行大幅超越。目前百度 AI 平台与自动驾驶逐渐起步，在内容上的积累也显示出护城河优势，综合实力来看，仍然是国内排名前七的互联网公司。\n数藏\n不同于国外公链环境，国内公司多选择数字藏品，或是开发在宣传中强调面向海外用户的公链 NFT 来规避可能的政策风险。但是百度也没有在数藏领域有大的动作，事实上无论是数藏还是公链 NFT，百度基本只负责销售，鲜少参与作品创作。数藏方面，百度曾经推出过三个平台，各个平台所发售的藏品各不相同，但整体与其他平台藏品无异，目前剩两个平台还在运营。\n发行\nNFT 方面，今年 8 月百度国际化事业部旗下的海外输入法 Simeji 与日本游戏开发商 ITI 合作共同发售 CryptoSimeji NFT。\n\nSimeji 作为日本下载量最高的手机输入法，在日本拥有超高人气，同时也是世界最大的颜文字社区。CryptoSimeji NFT 画风以 Simeji 品牌 Logo 为主，整体为小蘑菇像素风，有趣呆萌，加上之前有传言与ITI的合作除了NFT，还会有NFT衍生游戏，吸引了众多粉丝参与，Opensea 日榜冲到第四。小蘑菇总发行量 10000 个，团队自留 300。目前地板 0.075 ETH，最高为0.4ETH，总成交量 2671 ETH。\n小蘑菇路线图并未公布，官网给出 type to earn 玩法，但是目前只有第一阶段钻石手奖励，根据持有人的 NFT 持有数量及时间计算积分，瓜分总量20ETH 的奖池。小蘑菇整体属于小而美的项目，本身也是 Freemint，所以目前这个成绩表现良好。但是项目开图后，基本再无后续动作，所以地板止步0.4ETH，比较可惜。\nDuDuLab Project\n不同于 CryptoSimeji NFT ，百度在其第二个 NFT 项目 DuDuLab Project 中亲力亲为，项目设计、开发、运营计划等全由百度团队独立完成。NFT 主体形象也用上了百度第一大 IP——小度熊。\n\n百度对 DuDu 熊期望非常高，除了 IP 使用，更是投入 AI 技术作为项目核心。项目方将 DuDu 熊的经历设计为一部百万字的长篇小说，NFT 持有人参与共创，整部小说中的插画设计、宣发文案等也有 AIGC 身影。甚至在第二批空投中决定完全由 AI 生成 NFT，实现 AI 与 NFT 相结合。这种社群参与互动的方式其实更接近 WEB3 社群，百度希望以共创的方式与持有人及社群成员慢慢建立共识，从而讲出自己的故事。\nDuDu Lab 第一期发行总量 10000 个，地板最高 0.09ETH，目前0.042ETH，交易量 478ETH。后续持有者权益还将包括官方文创商品、品牌合作资源、二期 NFT 空投等。DuDu 熊本身资源配置不错，但是叙事对于熊市有些审美疲劳，地板价在mint初期遭纸手大量出货后，基本再无变化。\n哔哩哔哩：数藏平台和 Cheers UP NFT 系列\n哔哩哔哩简称 B 站，是位于中国上海的一家以 ACG 内容起家的弹幕视频分享网站。经过 13 年发展，已成长为中国年轻世代高度聚集的综合性视频社区。目前用户数 3.1 亿，月活达 2.93 亿，日活 8350 万，其中 35 岁以下用户占比超过 86%，24 岁以下超过 75%。日均使用时长更是达到了 82 分钟。\n围绕用户、创作者和内容，B 站构建了一个源源不断产生优质内容的生态系统，涵盖生活、游戏、时尚、知识、音乐等数千个品类和圈层，引领着流行文化的风潮，成为中文互联网极其独特的存在。目前，B 站 94% 的视频播放量都来自于专业用户创作的视频。在此基础之上，B 站提供了游戏、直播、付费内容、广告、漫画、电商等商业化产品服务，并对电竞、虚拟偶像等前沿领域展开战略布局。数字藏品也是其中之一。\n可能是熟悉年轻文化与创意市场，B 站的数藏跟 NFT 之路都走的非常顺畅。今年 1 月，B 站首款数藏头像“鸽德”上线，全网限量 2233 个，仅面向每日登陆的 6 级用户，其中 233 个由平台分给了部分知名 UP 主。4 月国内数藏行业合规提上日程后，其他平台纷纷遇冷，但 B 站仍然较为激进，在开放了 30 天免费转赠后，鸽德藏品价格一路走高，部分稀有属性更是达到万元以上。到了 7 月 B 站开始大量上新。根据 B 站数藏发售公告显示，8 月之前只有 15 款数藏作品，而截止 12 月 8 日，B 站总共发行数字藏品 42 款。频繁上新之下报名申购依然火爆。\n\n总结 B 站数藏成功原因有以下几点：\n差异化内容。各大平台数藏作品多集中在复刻古玩、名画品类，B 站数藏内容与其他平台有较为明显区别，自身二次元文化出发的数藏作品更加契合 B 站年轻用户。\n联动平台原生内容与 IP。例如鸽德藏品支持衍生品制作与线上二次创作，之后的绝大部分藏品除了数字头像本体外，还附带空间页交互视频与高清版权视频，同样支持二创与授权服务，全面助力优质内容推广。\n高使用场景。B 站数藏入口内置于 APP 中，自带的社交属性更易发挥数藏的稀缺性。除了头像本身的观赏属性，B站还为持有者增加了双击特效、直播礼物、特殊弹幕样式等个性化场景，增加趣味性的同时还增加了使用价值。\n30 天转赠时间。相比其他平台，较短的转赠与冷却时间无疑成为热度推动的助力一击。\n总体来看，虽然目前国内还存在版权、交易管理等问题，但 B 站数藏在内容、场景、价值上都走出了一条不一样的健康发展道路。\nNFT 方面，B 站在 4 月授权 Base Labs 向海外用户发行了“Cheers UP”系列 NFT，原定总量 10000 个，发行后实际 Mint 4526 个，后经Holders 投票决定销毁 5000 个，无公售及空投。cheers UP 国库预留241 个，Base Labs 团队预留 223 个。整体以验资抽奖形式发白，售价 0.12ETH。Cheers UP 采用双合约机制，根据是否开图分为 Cheers UP Period 及 Cheers UP Official，是否开图由持有者决定。NFT 形象来自 B 站社区文化“Bilibili 干杯”。\n\n除了上述提到的开盲盒，Cheers UP 还有一些别的有趣玩法。例如酿造/质押系统。持有人可以在官网通过酿造或质押获得累积积分 Z（开盒后为酿造功能，未开的盲盒提供对应质押功能），目前酿造每天 1 分，积分可以在商城中换取奖励。值得一提的是除了手机壳、礼盒等实物奖品外，还有 B 站大会员兑换卡。大会员是 B 站推出的付费会员机制，开通后可以解锁付费内容、4K 清晰度等。也可以选择兑换 Cheers UP NFT 盲盒。\n\n目前除了 Cheers UP NFT，B 站还发行了 Cheers up 表情包系列 NFT、干杯节 NFT 纪念徽章。Cheers UP 系列地板最高 1.15ETH，盲盒目前0.78ETH，交易量 2025ETH；已开图系列地板 0.529ETH，交易量 1040ETH。\n总体来看，Cheers UP 系列属于比较有诚意的，团队表现中规中矩，在初期 Mint 危机时表现出色，销毁使地板大涨 3 倍，但后期宣发较为停滞，未能走出国人圈子。期待下一个牛市可以晋级国产 NFT 之光。\n02 APE 和 LINK 质押背景、现状\n近期 Apecoin 和 Chainlink 均推出了代币质押。截止 12 月 13 日，据 ApeCoin 官方质押数据显示，APE 质押量已经突破 7000 万枚，价值逾 3 亿美元。而 Chainlink 社区质押池共 2250 枚 LINK 的额度也已经满额。下面将分别介绍 APE 和 LINK 质押背景、现状。\nApecoin 质押\nAPE 质押系统于 12 月 5 日上线，同时也正式开启为期一周的 Ape Staking 预质押阶段。Ape 代币质押激励从 12 月 12 日开启发放，基于 12 月 8 日预质押的数据，预期 APY 收益为 1000%+。\n据 Lookonchain 12 月 12 日 监测数据显示， APE 质押数量前三名均为 ApeCoin 基金会地址，共计质押 1220 万枚APE（约5160万美元）。第四名质押了约 145 万枚APE（约 615 万美元），第五名则质押了约 120 万枚APE（约 509 万美元）。\n据 Lookonchain 12 月 12 日 监测数据显示， APE 质押数量前三名均为 ApeCoin 基金会地址，共计质押 1220 万枚APE（约5160万美元），除此之外的第四名质押了约 145 万枚APE（约 615 万美元），第五名则质押了约 120 万枚APE（约 509 万美元）。\nApeCoin 质押机制\nAPE 质押系统有 4 个代币池，每个代币池的质押规则和奖励不同：\nApeCoin 池：该矿池不要求用户持有NFT，任何 APE 代币持有者都可以向该矿池存入尽可能多的 APE 代币。\nBAYC 池：该矿池要求用户持有一只 Bored Ape 才能参与其中。在 BAYC 池中，用户最多可以为他们持有的每个 Bored APE 存入 10,094 枚 APE 代币。\nMAYC 池：该池要求用户持有一只Mutant Ape 才能参与其中。在MAYC 池中，用户最多可以为他们持有的每个Mutant Ape 存入2, 042 枚APE。\nBAKC + BAYC 或 MAYC：该池不同于 BAYC 和 MAYC 池，用户不仅需要拥有一只 Bored Ape 或 Mutant Ape，还需要拥有一只 Bored Ape Kennel Club Dog，满足条件的用户可以为他们持有的每个 Bored Ape/Mutant Ape 和 BAKC Dog 存入最多 856 枚APE。\n以上 4 种代币池的奖励分配，将依据上一年 Q4 的 NFT 价格决定。其中，ApeCoin 池将固定分配当年总奖励池的 30% ，其余 3 个则随后续 NFT 价格浮动，NFT 价格越高，质押池对应的 APE 分配比率越高。\n参与 APE 质押的几种途径\nJamesX（@0xJamesXXX） 梳理了目前能参与 APE 质押活动的 4 个途径：\nApeStake.io 官方质押 在 ApeStake 中的质押权益是绑定于 NFT 的，如要售卖 NFT，需要先解除绑定和质押。否则 NFT 卖出后，质押收益将属于买方。 官方质押平台 ApeStake.io 上有质押状态查询工具，输入 NFT 的 ID 或钱包地址，便可查看相关 NFT 是否正使用质押功能，并显示质押的数量。\nParaSpace：NFT 抵押借贷并进行质押 ParaSpace 以 NFT 抵押借贷作为平台的基础逻辑，配合 Ape Staking 的机制，让 NFT 的持有者可以通过抵押借贷获得额外流动性资金，参与 Ape Staking 流动性挖矿从而持续获得 APE 代币挖矿奖励。ParaSpace 在智能合约中规避了官方质押存在的“直接卖出 NFT 损失质押收益”的问题。\nBendDAO：P2P 撮合 NFT 与 $APE 质押 NFT 持有者只需要质押 NFT 并设置好参与 APE Staking 质押收益的分成比率，等待与 APE 代币持有者配对后即可参与 APE Staking。APE 代币持有者则可以选择任意一个 Ape NFT 配对进行质押。\nBinance NFT：中心化匹配 NFT 和 $APE 质押 APE 代币持有者可以在 Staking 页面进行质押，NFT 持有者可以在 Binance NFT 平台质押 NFT，无需相应的 APE 代币配对质押。Binance 相当于为 Ape NFT 的持有者提供了一个中心化的质押服务。\nChainlink 质押\nChainlink 近期在其主办的 SmartCon 大会上介绍了过去一年中的重大研究成果，Chainlink Economics 2.0 预计会在今年 12 月份上线，Chainlink Economics 2.0 旨在提高数据安全性和实用性，同时降低预言机服务的运营成本，增加支付给 Chainlink 服务提供商的用户费用，让更广泛的群体参与到 Chainlink 生态系统中来。\nChainlink Economics 2.0 主要包括三个方面：Chainlink BUILD 、Chainlink SCALE 和 Staking。\nChainlink BUILD\nChainlink BUILD 允许项目方支付其原生代币的 3%-5% 来换取预言机服务，帮助还没有开始产生收入的新项目接入 Chainlink 的服务。这些代币将流向 Chainlink 网络和 LINK 代币的质押者，为 Chainlink 生态中的参与者带来了获得其它早期项目代币的机会。\nChainlink SCALE\nChainlink SCALE 支持 Layer 1 和 Layer 2 区块链可持续地访问 Chainlink。当区块链加入 SCALE 计划时，Chainlink 会获得部分赠款，以支付链上 Gas 费用。Avalanche、Metis、Moonbeam 和Moonriver 已确认参加 SCALE。\nStaking（质押）\nChainlink Staking v0.1 中，质押资金池的上限为 2500 万 LINK 代币，其中节点运营商可质押 300 万 LINK，社区可质押 2200 万 LINK，之后质押资金池扩大到 7500 万 LINK。\nChainlink Staking v0.1 会向质押者发行原生代币作为质押奖励，目标基础年化质押奖励为 5%。Chainlink 中国区负责人 Philip 告诉 PANews，v0.1 的质押者还有资格获得生态伙伴成长计划（PGP）的额外奖励。\n目前，开放的社区质押池共 2250 个 LINK 的额度已经满额。质押的 LINK 以及质押奖励将一直锁定到 v0.2 版本发布为止。v0.2 计划将于大约 9-12 个月之内发布。项目团队将于 2023 年初公布更多的细节信息。通过项目官方资料以及一些网络上的评论分析，可以窥探整理出 Chainlink 质押的长期目标：\n增加 Chainlink 服务的加密经济安全性和用户保证。\n让社区参与 Chainlink 网络。\n从真正的长期使用中产生可持续的回报。\n使节点运营者能够通过质押获得更高价值的工作。\n质押的引入是一个关键时刻，标志着向 Chainlink 经济学 2.0 的演变。\n参考链接 https://mirror.xyz/chaintide.eth/OV1UNVTrHq89Za-mjPwv-ocUVhc1feEzZIIWF7Qyuvk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSg0haBo5bI https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/16092

Yield) 的叙事后，Arbitrum 上的 GMX 带起了整个 Arbitrum 生态。以下为大家更新 Arbitrum 的现状。\nArbitrum 的 TVL 由 7 月的 6 亿美金到现在的 11 亿美金，其中 GMX 的 TVL 占了近 40%。跟据 DeFiLlama 的数据，Arbitrum TVL 在所有公链中排名第四，L2 公链中排名第一。\n\nAlchemy 的 Web3 开发者报告（2022 年第三季度）表明，Arbitrum 上活跃的开发者团队有高达 516% 的增长。年初至今，API 使用量增长了 121%。\n有潜力的项目\nVesta Finance\nVesta 是一个借贷协议。从 Liquity 分叉出来，Vesta 允许用户抵押各种去中心化资产，包括流行的基于 Arbitrum 的代币，如 GMX 和 DPX，以 0% 的利息铸造稳定币。\nUmami Finance\nUmami 是“Arbitrum 上的 Yearn”，它正在开发的金库（vault）将从基于 Arbitrum 的 DeFi 协议(如 GMX 的 GLP)中获得基于非排放的收益。虽然Umami最近弃用了他们的 V1 金库，其 V1 金库为储户提供了 GLP 的 Delta neutral（总体delta风险为零）敞口，该 DAO 仍然计划在 2022 年第四季度晚些时候发布 V2。\nY2K Finance\n用户可以据此推测某项资产是否会脱钩，或对冲其风险敞口。Y2K 还在开发一个锚定资产借贷市场，以及一个 RFQ 订单簿，用户可以轻松地在该平台不同的金库代币之间进行交易。\nRage Trade\nRage Trade 是一个永续合约交易所。该交易所的目标是通过 80/20 金库建立最具流动性的 ETH 永续合约：通过将 80% 的存款转入外部协议以赚钱收益，同时利用剩余的 20% 作为交易员的流动性，以提高 LP 的回报。Rage Trade 也计划集成 Layer 0，使 80/20 金库能够从任何 L1 或 L2 获得收益。\n参考链接 https://cointelegraphcn.com/news/5-under-the-radar-projects-on-arbitrum

Challenges then you’ll know how much skill and creativity is required to even attempt to build something cool in just 10 minutes. This year I wanted to try it myself so I could see if I have what it takes. After watching all the previous videos, I thought “OK, I’ll give it a go!”…</p><p>It was a great opportunity for me to test my speed and what I can build in 10 min in Webflow. Webflow is an incredible software for designers who love drag and drop. It allows you to create websites, including CMS, web apps, and templates.</p><p>Here are my top 8 lessons that I learned from this challenge-</p><ol><li><strong>Creativity</strong> The creative process is one of the most important parts of the project. This can be anything from a cool intro to a killer animation or a beautiful storyboard. The Webflow team provided us with some assets and Lottie animations that were to be used in the project. We weren’t allowed to use anything else. Using just these assets we had to show how creative we could get. With a great concept that can wow your audience, it doesn’t matter whether you build it in 3 min or more. e.g, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaisOfficial\">Shais</a> created ellipses on cursor movement in the qualifiers round in 5 min and managed to win everyone’s attention.</li><li><strong>Understand Webflow</strong> For this challenge, you need to know the tool inside out. You need to know the shortcuts with the keyboard to get faster and learn different aspects of Webflow to get creative. Many participants were using blend mode, blur, 3d perspective, transform, etc. to express their creativity. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kckatcreative\">KC</a> used a cat and added a blur effect to make it a cloud for her prompt on the Weather card UI in the semi-final round.</li><li><strong>Animation</strong> This year Webflow wanted to test how familiar you are with the interaction panel. This challenge helped me explore different types of animations that I could use in my projects. I had never used mouse movement before but during my practice sessions, I explored how to use this interaction. I went through a couple of “Made in Webflow” projects to find inspiration and learn how animations work. But the idea of the challenge was to keep your interactions simple yet creative, as you have got a time limit. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fxayuan\">Felixander Yuan</a> used many of the native Webflow interactions in his projects to go that extra mile.</li><li><strong>Practice</strong> It’s all about practice. The more you practice, the better, faster, and more confident you become. With practice, you start using the keyboard shortcuts efficiently and have more time to be creative with your build. It’s important to remember that you’ll make mistakes when you are on a live stage. But if you practice your build, you reduce the chances of error.</li><li><strong>Room for error</strong> When you are on the live stage you get nervous, and with the time limit, you always make errors when building the project. Instead of panicking, the idea is to overcome those errors. If possible, preview your project before the time limit ends, to make sure everything is working as planned.</li><li><strong>Get inspired</strong> At the end of the challenge, it was inspiring to see what all the challengers came up with their ideas, given the restriction of images and Lottie animations. Watching their projects broke the limitations of my creative imagination and inspired me to go even further.</li><li><strong>Reflection</strong> To be honest, when you are on the live stage you shake from the inside with nervousness and excitement. During the live stage, your mindset is important because many times we plan something else but execute differently. But once it’s over, you feel a different sense of achievement. You might feel that you could have done better or something different, but that’s the whole point. This challenge helped me reflect on what could have been better or different. It helped me reflect on my skills and knowledge.</li><li><strong>Have fun</strong> In the end, even if you don’t win the challenge, the bonus point is you get to know the other challengers and the Webflow community. You get inspired to learn more, do more and go beyond your imagination.</li></ol><p>I didn’t participate to win, I participated to test my capabilities and imagination.

[1/3]</a></p><p>In this part, we will dig deep into the course material that is appropriate to teach seniors.</p><h3>2. Course material</h3><p>In this section, I explained the materials that we taught in the classroom. We had to change and adjust the material as we went forward. I also explained the things that we learned and subjects that we found important for seniors. We also identified a couple of confusing topics and a couple of fun subjects. You can see the material that we taught below.</p><h4>1. Explain all the basics.</h4><figure><img alt=\"Explain all the basics.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*V_DfGlDYkjpO6MNLdVZBpg.gif\" /></figure><p>The whole concept of the internet, browses, tabs, and URLs was a confusing subject for them. You can make examples to make it easier to understand. For the URL, we explained it as an address in blue format. For the browser, we explained it as the door to the internet. The tabs were a little trickier. We said that your browser is getting doubled. Although we explained these concepts a lot (pretty much in every session😅), I’m sure that I couldn’t pass that knowledge to them to the degree that I wanted.</p><h4>2. Explain bookmarks.</h4><figure><img alt=\"Screen shot of bookmarks.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/845/0*JSwoTyac93OciiVy.png\" /><figcaption>Image by <a href=\"https://www.maketecheasier.com/keep-bookmarks-organized-chrome/\">maketecheasier.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Most seniors use the internet to do these things:</p><ul><li>Read the news.</li><li>Checking town events.</li><li>Play online games.</li><li>Attending online video calls.</li><li>Checking Facebook.</li><li>Sending and receiving pictures from their family and friends.</li></ul><p>Bookmarks can significantly help them find these things easier. Help them set up bookmarks for their most used pages.</p><h4>3. Explain passwords.</h4><figure><img alt=\"Explain passwords.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*0-0Fbb62Jllxw5cb-xZn3w.gif\" /></figure><p>All of them had frustrations with their password. Let’s face it; it even bothers us. But for them, it’s much more severe. Some of them don’t know the exact meaning of the username and password. They might confuse the application password with their device password. And almost all of them forget their password, and sometimes it’s impossible to retrieve because they forgot multiple passwords. They have different approaches to their passwords. Some of them write them in a notebook. Some have sticky notes on their devices. And none of them knows anything about password managers. So this is a key concept to teach. If they learn about that, they can automatically store their passwords, and it will be more accessible when they change devices.</p><h4>4. Explain icons.</h4><p>These Icons that we all know and believe are pretty clear were a big mystery for almost all of the seniors in the class. They always referred to them as symbols. And one of them told us how we suppose to know what’s the meaning of these signs and symbols.</p><p>This question hit me! I always thought icons were easy to understand. Seniors asked us to recommend a book with all those signs. I knew I couldn’t find one. Who writes a book about icons and their meaning? So I had to create a document for them myself. When I was preparing that document, I realized that many icons have the same appearance, but their meaning is different based on the context. It’s funny that we don’t pay attention to these details because we get used to them. Below you can see the document I created based on material design icons.</p><figure><img alt=\"material design icons list for print.

Many of them aren’t used to keyboards. (Unless they have been typists before, we had a grandma who could type very fast with ten fingures😎) They don’t know about autocorrect, autocomplete features, and voice commands. If you teach these to them, they would be revealed that they don’t have to type everything character per character. Especially the voice commands for searching addresses in Google Maps or searching on the internet. They might forget that in the next session, but keep reminding them that they don’t have to type everything.</p><h4>6. Teach Google Maps.</h4><figure><img alt=\"Teach Google Maps.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*-bw0cUype7_GHbYMns0vqw.gif\" /></figure><p>The session, we talked about Google Maps, was great. All of them find it very interesting and helpful. They were fascinated by the features and how easy it is to find an address and see the 360-degree location images on Google Street View.

Some of them are familiar with it to some degree. Bus some have no idea about it. Cover these topics in Email sessions:</p><ul><li>How to write an Email and send it.</li><li>How to attach something to an Email.</li><li>How to reply to an Email.</li><li>How to forward an Email.</li></ul><p>Don’t mention other details. Just cover the basics and ask them to do it a couple of times. The process of creating the Email is challenging for them to do. Do it yourself, and just teach them briefly how to log in. Even the login is not that important because their device stored that info, and when they want to change their device, they probably forget what you taught them.</p><figure><img alt=\"Gmail workbook first page -Senior Center Internet Course — By Sepideh Yazdi-sepidy\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/880/1*Q6CMOJ_0C_zcwaDCi1ucmQ.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"Gmail workbook second page -Senior Center Internet Course — By Sepideh Yazdi-sepidy.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/876/1*VlCbGIIQ06_iFY2NWeKzEg.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"Gmail workbook third page -Senior Center Internet Course — By Sepideh Yazdi-sepidy.png\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/881/1*5ZEjau6Ow1pOaSLAlzRepg.png\" /><figcaption>Three pages of the Google Maps workbook by <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/c2c891fcb5d9\">Sepideh Yazdi</a></figcaption></figure><h4>8. Short brief about streaming services.</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*Mybktj2X7H7AEp7WgXb2eA.gif\" /></figure><p>Most seniors have free time, and it’s fun for them to learn how they can use online entertainment. So we decided to teach a short brief about different streaming services. Unfortunately, we didn’t have much time to cover all the parts. We just introduced a couple of stream services to them. Most of them knew about Youtube, but they didn’t know how the subscription works and what values are offered. Their main question was why we should get a message for premium activation all the time and whether it is worth the money.</p><p>We introduced services for movies and music. They wanted to know whether they could find old movies and old classic songs or not. When we explained they could, they were thrilled. We helped one of them find an old TV series online, and she was so happy about it. So if you want to make your grandparents happy, help them find their favorite old movies or songs! You can’t imagine how glad they will be when they see those things.</p><h3>Summary</h3><figure><img alt=\"Course materials Summary of Part 2 — by Sepideh Yazdi — sepidy.com\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z6gTz0Kndsmtc1s_kbJEIA.png\" /><figcaption>Summary of part 2 — Important points while teaching — by <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/c2c891fcb5d9\">Sepideh Yazdi</a></figcaption></figure><p>This is the end of the <strong>second part</strong> of this <strong>three-part series</strong>.

It’s about understanding how to add value to the person you want to reach out to, so you stand out from all the other people who want the same thing.</p><p>In other words, the strategy is about learning how to get what you want, by learning how to get people what they want.</p><h4><strong>3 steps to make it work</strong></h4><ol><li>Know where you are</li></ol><p>Be humble and recognize that the person you want to connect with may have more experience, knowledge, and status. In the opposite way, if you’ve been a designer for a while, there are people ‘below’ you who have less knowledge and experience because they’re just starting out. It’s important you are completely honest with yourself here. Recognize and accept your current situation. You should not act as if you have years of experience if you are just starting out, but you should also avoid undervaluing yourself. The sooner you do this, the sooner you will be able to advance in your career.</p><p>2. Do your research</p><p>Assume you want to contact someone who has your dream job. You might wonder, “Why would this person want to contact me?” Or worse, you never considered this and simply sent the person a generic message like every other designer out there. That’s where research comes in.</p><p>You’re putting work on this person if you send a general message about what you can do for them or if you can meet. You are also unlikely to get a response. Instead, do some research on what this person might be looking for and think of a way to add value.</p><p>3. Do it</p><p>After you’ve come up with something that adds value to this person, put it into action without expecting anything in return. Make that redesign, address this person’s frustrations, or connect with someone this person wants to meet.</p><h3>Show your work</h3><p>Show your work on the internet. This is important because it allows people to find you. You are developing your personal brand by putting things out there. It shows who you are, and you may be surprised at how many people approach you. Opportunities often come from unexpected places.</p><figure><img alt=\"Girl leaning against a sofa while sitting on the ground with her laptop.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XR_I4NyWmC-PGNgL\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@thoughtcatalog?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Thought Catalog</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>If you believe you have nothing interesting to say, think again. What is obvious to you may be amazing for others. It doesn’t have to be anything big or special. Start by sharing some content on LinkedIn, for example. When you share some first things, the bar for further sharing is often lowered, and you may surprise yourself.</p><h3>Be genuine</h3><p>Don’t get too caught up in all the network-building advice. You’re probably thinking, “But you just gave me those?” I’m not saying that knowing about the various ways you can do this isn’t useful, but when you’re out there connecting with people, you should just show genuine interest and get to know them. It’s not fair to act as if you’re interested in the person you’re speaking with. In addition, to make a situation like that work, you must be an incredible actor. When people notice you’re not interested, the conversation will die out and both sides will have wasted energy.</p><p>Focus on adding value to the other person rather than what you want from them. Develop a desire to meet interesting people. Both parties will benefit in the end, so just enjoy it.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=15e487bb76db\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://uxplanet.org/portfolio-didnt-use-it-still-got-the-job-15e487bb76db\">Portfolio: didn’t use it, still got the job</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://uxplanet.org\">UX Planet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Why a portfolio isn’t everything and how you do get that job.\nI used to think a good portfolio was everything.

The sooner you do this, the sooner you will be able to advance in your career.\n2. Do your research\nAssume you want to contact someone who has your dream job. You might wonder, “Why would this person want to contact me?” Or worse, you never considered this and simply sent the person a generic message like every other designer out there. That’s where research comes in.\nYou’re putting work on this person if you send a general message about what you can do for them or if you can meet. You are also unlikely to get a response. Instead, do some research on what this person might be looking for and think of a way to add value.\n3. Do it\nAfter you’ve come up with something that adds value to this person, put it into action without expecting anything in return. Make that redesign, address this person’s frustrations, or connect with someone this person wants to meet.\nShow your work\nShow your work on the internet. This is important because it allows people to find you. You are developing your personal brand by putting things out there. It shows who you are, and you may be surprised at how many people approach you. Opportunities often come from unexpected places.\nPhoto by Thought Catalog on Unsplash\nIf you believe you have nothing interesting to say, think again. What is obvious to you may be amazing for others. It doesn’t have to be anything big or special. Start by sharing some content on LinkedIn, for example. When you share some first things, the bar for further sharing is often lowered, and you may surprise yourself.\nBe genuine\nDon’t get too caught up in all the network-building advice. You’re probably thinking, “But you just gave me those?” I’m not saying that knowing about the various ways you can do this isn’t useful, but when you’re out there connecting with people, you should just show genuine interest and get to know them. It’s not fair to act as if you’re interested in the person you’re speaking with. In addition, to make a situation like that work, you must be an incredible actor. When people notice you’re not interested, the conversation will die out and both sides will have wasted energy.\nFocus on adding value to the other person rather than what you want from them. Develop a desire to meet interesting people. Both parties will benefit in the end, so just enjoy it.\n\nPortfolio: didn’t use it, still got the job was originally published in UX Planet on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Sanne Eikelboom","guid":"https://medium.com/p/15e487bb76db","categories":["ux-design","user-experience","product-design","ux","design"],"isoDate":"2022-12-14T14:41:06.000Z","from":"https://uxplanet.org/feed","hashId":"e1a5b424b736f68a9f8ef5288580f900"},{"creator":"Ruben Ferreira Duarte","title":"Not all deadlines are to be taken seriously","link":"https://uxplanet.org/not-all-deadlines-are-to-be-taken-seriously-c7feb5c9a1ae?source=rss----819cc2aaeee0---4","pubDate":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 14:47:03 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>Think more about the strategy than the calendar</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4ayUH9zMcJxAk-qLJxwc7A.jpeg\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jontyson\">© Jon Tyson</a></figcaption></figure><p>It is not uncommon for the daunting deadlines of many projects to be the terror of any design team.

Through user research, we can answer important questions about our design, such as <em>Who are our users?</em> and <em>What do they need?</em></p><p>In this blog post, we will discuss six common user research methods, what they are, when to use them, and some common challenges associated with each one.</p><p>Let’s get started …</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/user-research-methods/#whatis\">What is User Research?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/user-research-methods/#whyis\">Why is User Research Integral to the UX Process?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/user-research-methods/#methods\">6 Common User Research Methods</a></li><li><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/user-research-methods/#getstarted\">How To Get Started With User Research In UX Design Projects</a></li><li><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/user-research-methods/#key\">Key Takeaways</a></li></ul><h3>What is User Research?</h3><p><strong>User research is a process of gathering data about users in order to design better products that meet their needs</strong>.</p><p>It’s used in every part of the design process, from the initial market research and concepting stages, through the final interface design testing and iteration stages.</p><p><strong>The goal:</strong> to gather data that will allow you to make informed decisions as you create design solutions.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*j4sI1kRSQqEN1jWF.jpg\" /></figure><h4>Term Check: User Research vs. UX Research</h4><p>Depending on what you read, you might come across the terms <strong>user research</strong>, <strong>UX research</strong>, or simply <strong>design research</strong> — all used interchangeably.</p><p>While they all tend to refer to the process of collecting user-centric data, there is some distinction that can be applied:</p><p>The term <strong>user research</strong> is often used when you want to learn more about the target audience for a product or service; who they are, how they think, what their goals are, etc.</p><p><strong>UX research</strong>, on the other hand, tends to be used when you’re conducting research that focuses on how users interact with a product or service.</p><p>In this article, we’ll be looking at user research holistically, whether specifically talking about the users themselves, or learning more about how they interact with and experience your design work.</p><h3>Why is User Research Integral to the UX Process?</h3><p>User research is an integral part of the design process: it ensures you have enough <a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/what-is-data-driven-design/\">data and insights</a> to make informed decisions about the design work you produce, reducing the risk of making assumptions and creating something no one truly wants.</p><p>Successful UX design requires a deep understanding of the people who will be using your product and how they interact with it. No matter how experienced you are as a designer, there is no way to validate your assumptions about design solutions without data. And the only way to acquire this understanding is by collecting data from the users themselves.</p><h3>6 Common User Research Methods</h3><p>There are a variety of user research methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are 6 common methodologies that are easy to incorporate into your UX design process.</p><h4>1. User Interviews</h4><p>Interviews are a type of user research method in which the researcher talks with participants to collect data. This method is used to gather insights about people’s attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and experiences. Interviews are a great way to gather in-depth, <a href=\"https://designlab.com/ux-glossary/what-is-qualitative-data/\">qualitative data</a> from users.</p><p>Interviews are best conducted in a live conversation, whether that takes place in person, on a video call, or even on the phone. They can be structured or unstructured, depending on what best fits your research needs:</p><ul><li><strong>Structured interviews</strong> follow a set list of questions</li><li><strong>Unstructured interviews</strong> are intended for more open-ended conversation</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p><p>When deciding whether to use interviews as a user research method, it is important to consider the goals of the research, the target audience, and the availability of resources. Interviews are extremely time-consuming, both for the interviewer and the interviewee. However, if the goal of the research is to observe behavior in a natural setting, or if the target audience is not available to participate in interviews, then another user research method may be more appropriate.</p><h4>2. Surveys</h4><p>Surveys are a user research method in which participants are asked to answer a series of questions, usually about a specific topic. Surveys are well suited for collecting data that can be quantified, but they are not as well suited for collecting qualitative data, since answers are often nuanced and lack appropriate context.</p><p><strong>Surveys are best used when …</strong></p><p>Since surveys can be easily distributed to a large number of people, they’re often a good choice for gathering information from people who might not be able — or willing — to participate in other types of user research (such as usability testing).</p><p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p><p>Since surveys rely on self-reported data, it’s important to avoid phrases or words that might influence the users’ answers. Furthermore, this type of user research often provides data without context, since you aren’t able to follow up and understand some of the nuances of the responses.</p><h4>3. Focus Groups</h4><p>Focus groups are a type of user research method in which a group of people are brought together to discuss a product, service, or experience. Focus groups provide an opportunity for users to discuss their experiences and opinions with each other in a guided setting. When done correctly, focus groups can provide valuable insights that can help shape both product design and marketing strategies.</p><p><strong>Focus groups are best used when …</strong></p><p>Focus groups can help uncover user needs and perspectives that may not be apparent through individual interviews or surveys.</p><p><strong>Tips to make it work:</strong></p><p>To get the most out of a focus group, it is important to carefully select participants that are representative of the target audience, as well as those who represent various accessibility needs, which might otherwise be overlooked or receive less consideration. The moderator should also be skilled in leading discussions and facilitating group dynamics to avoid participants from influencing each other.</p><h4>4. A/B Testing</h4><p>A/B testing is a user research method in which two versions of a design are created, then tested against each other to determine which is more effective.</p><p>These versions can be identical except for one small change, or they can be completely different. Once the two versions have been created, they are then assigned to users at random. The results of the test are then analyzed to see which version was more successful.</p><p><strong>A/B testing is best used when …</strong></p><p>You can incorporate A/B testing at any stage of the design process, but you might find you get the most helpful insights when you’re in a state of refinement, or are at a crossroads and need some data to help you decide which route to take.</p><p><strong>Tips to make it work:</strong></p><p>Once you have your design variations ready to test, it’s up to the developers (or an A/B testing software program) to make the test live to users. It’s important to let the test run long enough so that any statistical significance is steady and repeatable. (If the test does not provide statistically significant results, it’s time to go back to the drawing board and try out a different variation.)</p><h4>5. Card Sorting</h4><p>Card sorting is a user research method that can be used to help understand how people think about the items in a given category. Card sorting involves providing users with a set of cards, each of which contains an item from the category, and asking them to sort the cards into groups. The groups can be based on any criteria that the users choose, and the sorted cards can then be analyzed to identify patterns in the way that the users think about the items. Card sorting can be used with both small and large sets of items, making it a versatile tool for user research.</p><p><strong>Card sorting is best used when …</strong></p><p>You are looking for insight into categorical questions like how to structure the <a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/guide-to-information-architecture/\">information architecture</a> of a website.</p><p>For example, if you were designing a website for a library, you might use card sorting to understand how users would expect the website’s content to be organized.</p><p><strong>Tips to make it work:</strong></p><p>Like the other research methods mentioned so far, a successful card sorting exercise requires a significant amount of thought and setup ahead of time. You might use an <strong>open sorting session</strong>, where the users create their own categories, if you want insight into the grouping logic of your users. In a <strong>closed sorting session</strong>, the categories are already defined, but it’s up to the participants to decide where to file each card.</p><h4>6. Tree Test</h4><p>Tree testing is a user research method that helps evaluate the findability and usability of website content. It is often used as a follow-up to card sorting, or when there are large amounts of website content, multiple website navigation structures, or changes to an existing website.</p><p>To conduct a tree test, participants are asked to find specific items on a website, starting from the home page. They are not told what the navigation options are, but are given hints if they get stuck. This helps researchers understand how users find and interact with the website content.</p><p><strong>Tree testing is best used when …</strong></p><p>This method is most effective when combined with other user research methods, such as interviews, surveys, and focus groups. This is because it’s really a way to finesse the user’s experience at the end of the design process, rather than a method of collecting the preliminary data that’s needed to arrive at this point.</p><p><strong>Tips to make it work:</strong></p><p>Tree testing can be a challenging method to conduct, as it requires specific instructions and data collection methods for each test. In addition, participants may not use the same navigation paths that you intended, making it difficult to analyze the results. To account for this, it’s important to have a large enough sample size to be able to differentiate between outliers and general trends.</p><h3>How To Get Started With User Research In UX Design Projects</h3><p>User research is a critical part of any project or product development process.

Through user research, we can answer important questions about our design, such as Who are our users? and What do they need?\nIn this blog post, we will discuss six common user research methods, what they are, when to use them, and some common challenges associated with each one.\nLet’s get started …\n\nWhat is User Research?\nWhy is User Research Integral to the UX Process?\n6 Common User Research Methods\nHow To Get Started With User Research In UX Design Projects\nKey Takeaways\n\nWhat is User Research?\nUser research is a process of gathering data about users in order to design better products that meet their needs.\nIt’s used in every part of the design process, from the initial market research and concepting stages, through the final interface design testing and iteration stages.\nThe goal: to gather data that will allow you to make informed decisions as you create design solutions.\n\nTerm Check: User Research vs. UX Research\nDepending on what you read, you might come across the terms user research, UX research, or simply design research — all used interchangeably.\nWhile they all tend to refer to the process of collecting user-centric data, there is some distinction that can be applied:\nThe term user research is often used when you want to learn more about the target audience for a product or service; who they are, how they think, what their goals are, etc.\nUX research, on the other hand, tends to be used when you’re conducting research that focuses on how users interact with a product or service.\nIn this article, we’ll be looking at user research holistically, whether specifically talking about the users themselves, or learning more about how they interact with and experience your design work.\nWhy is User Research Integral to the UX Process?\nUser research is an integral part of the design process: it ensures you have enough data and insights to make informed decisions about the design work you produce, reducing the risk of making assumptions and creating something no one truly wants.\nSuccessful UX design requires a deep understanding of the people who will be using your product and how they interact with it. No matter how experienced you are as a designer, there is no way to validate your assumptions about design solutions without data. And the only way to acquire this understanding is by collecting data from the users themselves.\n6 Common User Research Methods\nThere are a variety of user research methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are 6 common methodologies that are easy to incorporate into your UX design process.\n1.

So far in 2022, brands including Samsung, GAP, Patrón, Hennessy, Konami, Associated Press, Budweiser, Barbie and Bugatti have all announced NFT launches, with many other organisations making plans to adapt their <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/culture-week/2021/12/14/how-brands-can-build-in-the-metaverse/\">businesses for the metaverse</a>.</p>\n<p>An NFT is simply a unique digital asset, with provable provenance and ownership recorded on a blockchain. Thanks to NFTs, we know who owns a digital asset, such as a photo, video, drawing or piece of music. This proof-of-ownership allows digital assets to have value and be traded on marketplaces, such as <a href=\"http://opensea.io\">OpenSea</a>, <a href=\"https://looksrare.org/\">LooksRare</a> and <a href=\"https://rarible.com/\">Rarible</a>.</p>\n<p>With this context in mind, an area that I’ve yet to see explored is the <strong>use of NFTs as a brand loyalty mechanism</strong>. To date, brands have focused on NFTs as highly exclusive collectibles targeted mostly at NFT collectors and enthusiasts, rather than a way to engage their regular customers.</p>\n<p>Quite simply, I believe issuing NFTs to reward loyal customers could produce better results for brands than traditional loyalty programmes, as well as draw in new customers.</p>\n<p>Let’s consider how NFTs could increase brand loyalty. At a high level, there are three main reasons why NFTs will create loyal customers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"1-desirable-collectibles\">1. Desirable Collectibles</h3>\n<p><em>Brands can design memorable digital assets that customers want to show-off.</em></p>\n<p>NFTs can be anything digital - an image, video, audio clip, drawing etc.</p>\n<p>A brand’s NFT could be relatively simple - a logo or representation or a product - or something more complex like a totally new piece of IP, exclusively designed for the NFT.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, it needs to be in some way appealing to the buyer, typically aesthetically. If a physical product is poorly packaged or aesthetically undesirable, it’s less likely to command a high price. The same isn’t always true of NFTs, but it certainly helps.</p>\n<p>In web 2, consumers like to align themselves with their favourite brands - posting on social media about the shoes, jumpers, cars and watches they buy, or restaurants, cafes and hotels they visit.</p>\n<p>Showing off the NFTs you own on social media or in digital galleries is the next big form of brand interaction. At the time of writing, Twitter has recently rolled out NFT profile picture verification, enabling NFT owners to publicly demonstrate their ownership of an NFT. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/facebook-and-instagram-may-help-you-create-and-sell-nfts/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABxPCmykv36QSQ1eWYkjLogfRZ_tQs721Mw0UL4vS8Zo-jCGgRA0OLR14SgJ8WXW1HhNs9e697WbVAF_vd2UxDPqt9lLhTNIWNfjM45V6C2cxEZG1pm_NN6TX9URa9NBlrEA8uylQF2bCYr6FxAkF-qGZioLf5i_GjiE1tCvAhrr\">Facebook and Instagram</a> are also preparing to offer users the opportunity to show off their NFT collections.</p>\n<p>As a brand, NFTs offer a way to form part of your customer’s online identity, an area which is sure to grow over the coming years.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2--exclusive-benefits\">2.  Exclusive Benefits</h3>\n<p><em>Brands can give NFTs utility (benefits) related to their brand.</em></p>\n<p>For a brand, an NFT can provide its owner with exclusive benefits, starting with those of “traditional” loyalty schemes (discounts, early access to new items and free products).</p>\n<p>This should be combined with deeper, community-focused benefits, an approach which many top NFT projects have demonstrated successfully - see <a href=\"https://boredapeyachtclub.com/\">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a>, <a href=\"https://veefriends.com/\">VeeFriends</a> and smaller projects like <a href=\"https://etherealcollective.io/\">Ethereal Collective</a>.</p>\n<p>Example benefits a brand can offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical collectibles - GAP’s NFT launch included the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22881943/gap-nft-hoodies-frank-ape\">opportunity to redeem a limited edition hoodie</a></li>\n<li>Access to the brand’s founders or expert team - online, in a Discord server or even in-person</li>\n<li>Invites to brand events or other offline utility - launch events, fashion shows, food and drink tastings, parties, meetups, access to clubs and bars. Whatever is appropriate to your brand</li>\n<li>Future free airdrops of other NFTs or tokens - from the same brand when new NFTs are launched or from other partner projects and brands</li>\n<li>Access to online communities for NFT holders - such as on Discord servers. These communities are based around shared interest and passions. Crucially, the incentives of participants with a community are aligned: primarily, growth in value of the NFT, and secondarily in the NFT’s utility being delivered by the brand that created the NFT<ul>\n<li>Many NFT projects generate their own marketing buzz once launched, as holders create content to share the collection with others</li>\n<li>Members of the community may even develop derivative projects, such as additional NFTs, to reward their fellow holders</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NFT projects with well thought-through utility encourage holders to keep holding and promoting their ownership of the NFT.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3--make-money\">3.  Make Money</h3>\n<p><em>The big one: customers can make money supporting their favourite brand.</em></p>\n<p>A brand distributing an NFT to its customers is offering a type of ownership in the success of the brand.</p>\n<p>Due to the properties of NFTs discussed earlier, NFTs can be bought and sold using open marketplaces. Transaction history is transparently recorded on the blockchain, meaning that the prices of a brand’s NFT collection and its owners are public knowledge.</p>\n<p>This dynamic makes NFTs tradeable assets that fluctuate in price. If the demand for a brand&#39;s NFT rises, the price will rise. Those who hold the NFT (having either purchased or been given the NFT by the brand, a subject for a future article!) have the option to cash out for a profit.</p>\n<p>With NFTs, brand advocates can benefit financially from their support for the brand.</p>\n<p>There are many circumstances that could impact the demand for a brand&#39;s NFT - from customers, collectors, or speculators. For example:</p>\n<p>A clothing brand may become more fashionable as a celebrity starts wearing its clothes. A coffee shop might become more popular as a tech company opens a new office next door. An F1 team might win their first race and receive an influx of new fans and attention.</p>\n<p>When a great community, great rewards and great art come together in an NFT drop, over time, more people become interested in owning a piece of the drop.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In summary, NFTs will enable brands to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become a part of customers’ online identity</li>\n<li>Reward customers with utility</li>\n<li>Offer a significant financial incentive to keep supporting the brand</li>\n</ul>\n<p>...all of which can drive brand loyalty.</p>\n<p>NFTs flip the incentive structure of loyalty schemes on their head. Rather than a loyalty programme being a way to offer loyal customers a discount for purchasing, NFT loyalty programmes instead offer upside in the brand’s future success. This stake in the business will not only lead to repeat purchases and customers sharing their love for the brand with others, but also rewards them for doing so.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If we’ve not been introduced, my name is Fraser and over the last year I’ve been part of the founding team at Melon.

This proof-of-ownership allows digital assets to have value and be traded on marketplaces, such as OpenSea, LooksRare and Rarible.\nWith this context in mind, an area that I’ve yet to see explored is the use of NFTs as a brand loyalty mechanism. To date, brands have focused on NFTs as highly exclusive collectibles targeted mostly at NFT collectors and enthusiasts, rather than a way to engage their regular customers.\nQuite simply, I believe issuing NFTs to reward loyal customers could produce better results for brands than traditional loyalty programmes, as well as draw in new customers.\nLet’s consider how NFTs could increase brand loyalty. At a high level, there are three main reasons why NFTs will create loyal customers.\n1. Desirable Collectibles\nBrands can design memorable digital assets that customers want to show-off.\nNFTs can be anything digital - an image, video, audio clip, drawing etc.\nA brand’s NFT could be relatively simple - a logo or representation or a product - or something more complex like a totally new piece of IP, exclusively designed for the NFT.\nFundamentally, it needs to be in some way appealing to the buyer, typically aesthetically. If a physical product is poorly packaged or aesthetically undesirable, it’s less likely to command a high price. The same isn’t always true of NFTs, but it certainly helps.\nIn web 2, consumers like to align themselves with their favourite brands - posting on social media about the shoes, jumpers, cars and watches they buy, or restaurants, cafes and hotels they visit.\nShowing off the NFTs you own on social media or in digital galleries is the next big form of brand interaction. At the time of writing, Twitter has recently rolled out NFT profile picture verification, enabling NFT owners to publicly demonstrate their ownership of an NFT. Facebook and Instagram are also preparing to offer users the opportunity to show off their NFT collections.\nAs a brand, NFTs offer a way to form part of your customer’s online identity, an area which is sure to grow over the coming years.\n2.  Exclusive Benefits\nBrands can give NFTs utility (benefits) related to their brand.\nFor a brand, an NFT can provide its owner with exclusive benefits, starting with those of “traditional” loyalty schemes (discounts, early access to new items and free products).\nThis should be combined with deeper, community-focused benefits, an approach which many top NFT projects have demonstrated successfully - see Bored Ape Yacht Club, VeeFriends and smaller projects like Ethereal Collective.\nExample benefits a brand can offer:\nPhysical collectibles - GAP’s NFT launch included the opportunity to redeem a limited edition hoodie\nAccess to the brand’s founders or expert team - online, in a Discord server or even in-person\nInvites to brand events or other offline utility - launch events, fashion shows, food and drink tastings, parties, meetups, access to clubs and bars. Whatever is appropriate to your brand\nFuture free airdrops of other NFTs or tokens - from the same brand when new NFTs are launched or from other partner projects and brands\nAccess to online communities for NFT holders - such as on Discord servers. These communities are based around shared interest and passions. Crucially, the incentives of participants with a community are aligned: primarily, growth in value of the NFT, and secondarily in the NFT’s utility being delivered by the brand that created the NFT\nMany NFT projects generate their own marketing buzz once launched, as holders create content to share the collection with others\nMembers of the community may even develop derivative projects, such as additional NFTs, to reward their fellow holders\nNFT projects with well thought-through utility encourage holders to keep holding and promoting their ownership of the NFT.\n3.  Make Money\nThe big one: customers can make money supporting their favourite brand.\nA brand distributing an NFT to its customers is offering a type of ownership in the success of the brand.\nDue to the properties of NFTs discussed earlier, NFTs can be bought and sold using open marketplaces. Transaction history is transparently recorded on the blockchain, meaning that the prices of a brand’s NFT collection and its owners are public knowledge.\nThis dynamic makes NFTs tradeable assets that fluctuate in price. If the demand for a brand's NFT rises, the price will rise. Those who hold the NFT (having either purchased or been given the NFT by the brand, a subject for a future article!) have the option to cash out for a profit.\nWith NFTs, brand advocates can benefit financially from their support for the brand.\nThere are many circumstances that could impact the demand for a brand's NFT - from customers, collectors, or speculators. For example:\nA clothing brand may become more fashionable as a celebrity starts wearing its clothes. A coffee shop might become more popular as a tech company opens a new office next door. An F1 team might win their first race and receive an influx of new fans and attention.\nWhen a great community, great rewards and great art come together in an NFT drop, over time, more people become interested in owning a piece of the drop.\nIn summary, NFTs will enable brands to:\nBecome a part of customers’ online identity\nReward customers with utility\nOffer a significant financial incentive to keep supporting the brand\n...all of which can drive brand loyalty.\nNFTs flip the incentive structure of loyalty schemes on their head. Rather than a loyalty programme being a way to offer loyal customers a discount for purchasing, NFT loyalty programmes instead offer upside in the brand’s future success. This stake in the business will not only lead to repeat purchases and customers sharing their love for the brand with others, but also rewards them for doing so.\nIf we’ve not been introduced, my name is Fraser and over the last year I’ve been part of the founding team at Melon. At Melon we’ve built an NFT platform and marketplace for social media creators and celebrities to launch their first NFTs. Next, we're building a platform to allow any creator to launch their own DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation).\nPrior to joining Melon I worked as an innovation consultant and for SaveTheHighStreet.org with hundreds of independent retailers and brands. Before that I launched ecommerce business, MEXI Clothing.\nThis article is part of a series of articles I’ll be releasing on the creator economy, brands, retail and web 3.

</p>\n<p>所有参与维护以太坊的节点，所谓的共识，甚至是以太坊本身存在的意义，就是为了保证状态连续、统一，让每个节点看到的当前状态一致。EVM就是维护一致的规则和环境。</p>\n<h3 id=\"evm-兼容\">EVM 兼容</h3>\n<p>若某区块链是 EVM 兼容的，简单理解，以太坊现有开发者，可在稍加改动后，将以太坊上现有 DApp 直接“复制粘贴”到该链上。</p>\n<p>EVM 兼容，可让开发者使用熟悉的 Solidity 语言编写智能合约，且能便捷地将以太坊上现有智能合约部署至该链。 </p>\n<p>对用户来说，EVM 兼容链地址与以太坊相同，支持 Metamask 等主流钱包，操作习惯相同，Gas更低，Tps 更高。 当前，无论是地址数量、现有开发者数量、新开发者的选择还是流动性，以太坊都处于领先地位。 </p>\n<p>所以，以太坊开发语言 Solidity 和 EVM 虚拟机实际已成为区块链标准。 在上一轮牛市 DeFi 之夏与 NFT、GameFi 热潮中，EVM 兼容链承接了以太坊外溢价值，发展出以 BNB 链、Avalanche C网、Polygon、Fantom 等为代表的 EVM 生态。 </p>\n<p>当前，以 Arbitrum、Optimism 为代表的 Optimistic Rollup 以 EVM 兼容性逐渐在 Rollup 竞争中取得优势。 而 zk-Rollup 需要解决 EVM 兼容问题，其实就是让零知识证明（ZK）这项技术，与以太坊 EVM  更好地，在兼容以太坊现有基础设施的前提下，提高 ZK 证明生成和验证效率。</p>\n<h3 id=\"zk-rollup-evm-问题\">zk-Rollup EVM 问题</h3>\n<p>zk-Rollup EVM 兼容，之所以成为一个需要解决的问题，原因是以太坊在创立之初，并未考虑兼容 ZK 技术。</p>\n<p>用 EVM 直接生成、验证 ZK 证明的速度极慢，以太坊目前情况，可能要几个小时。 zk-Rollup 需要在 EVM 兼容与 ZK 效率之间，做平衡。</p>\n<h3 id=\"zkevm-不同类型及代表项目\">zkEVM 不同类型及代表项目</h3>\n<p>关于 zkEVM 分类，Vitalik 曾在博客里，进行过详细划分。下图是 Vitalik 在原文中插入的图片。横轴为 ZK 性能效率，纵轴为与以太坊的兼容度。 可以看到，类型一兼容性最强，但 ZK 性能最差。而类型四，ZK 性能最强，但兼容性最差。 若要严谨些，这里需要区分“等效”与“兼容”。 简单理解，比如我上一台电脑是 Apple 系统，新电脑仍使用该系统。可直接通过 Apple Cloud 恢复先前的文件和设置，这可以理解成“等效”。 若新电脑换成了 Windows 系统，原有的文件需要通过云盘下载，转换格式恢复，这可以理解为“兼容”。</p>\n<p>类型1，共识级别等效：与以太坊完全等效的 zkEVM</p>\n<p>在共识级别上与以太坊等效，该类型的 zkEVM 链状态、事物等与以太坊完全相同，可直接使用以太坊执行客户端，与以太坊相互验证区块。所以，该类型 zkEVM，也被称为“Enshrined Rollups”。</p>\n<p>类型1 zkEVM 使以太坊本身更具可扩展性，在其上的一些探索，可直接引入以太坊主网。 缺点是，ZK 证明效率极差，需要大量计算验证 ZK。 解决办法是，未来可以通过大规模并行化验证器，或通过 zk-SNARK 专用集成电路缓解。 理论上，一个 ZK 效率高的类型1 zkEVM，是 zkEVM 未来最理想的形态。 目前，构建或探索该类型的主要团队有 AppliedZKP、Taiko。</p>\n<p>类型2，字节码级别等效：与 EVM 完全等效</p>\n<p>不完全等效以太坊，但完全等效 EVM。与以太坊在数据结构，比如区块结构和状态树有所不同，删除了部分对 ZK 不友好的堆栈。</p>\n<p>完全兼容以太坊现有 DApp、调试工具和开发人员基础设施。 缺点是对 ZK 不友好，效率低且昂贵。 未来的 Scroll、Polygon Hermez 正在向这个方向努力。</p>\n<p>类型2.5：与类似2相似，但修改了 Gas 费用</p>\n<p>在类型2的优势上多了一点，Gas 费用低。</p>\n<p>类型3，字节码级别等效：几乎等效 EVM</p>\n<p>在类型2基础上，进一步牺牲兼容性，提高 ZK 效率。删除在 zkEVM 上较难实现的功能，比如预编译 Compile，使得一些需要该功能的 DApp，部分代码需要重新编写。 一般认为目前的 Scroll 和 Polygon Hermez 处于该阶段。</p>\n<p>类型4，开发语言级别等效：高级语言等效 EVM</p>\n<p>拥有最高的 ZK 性能，但兼容性较差。 目前代表项目有 StarkWare 和 zkSync。</p>\n<p>zkEVM类型部分较难理解，技术名词多、枯燥，项目方、部分开发者与分析师之间，在定义方面存在分歧，观点不一致，造成不同内容间存在出入。</p>\n<p>但大家不要过分陷入技术概念中。zkEVM 实现目的，目前最主要的，仍是方便以太坊现有开发者，便于以太坊现有项目部署，以此增加自身生态项目，实现网络效应。 类型1到4，是各个 zkEVM 项目对于兼容性和 ZK 效率不同的取舍。</p>\n<h3 id=\"zkvm-与-zkwasm\">zkVM 与 zkWASM</h3>\n<p>zkEVM 是 ZK + 以太坊虚拟机 EVM，而 zkVM 则是 ZK + 其他生态虚拟机 VM。问题是，ZK 还有没有可能兼容更大的生态，比如 Web2 ？ 这就要说到 zkWASM（zk-WebAssembly） 以及 Manta Network 参与发起的 ZPrize 计划。 </p>\n<p>WASM（WebAssembly）诞生于传统互联网，由万维网联盟（W3C）创建，是可在 Web 中运行的语言格式，具备体积小、性能高、可移植性强等特点。 几乎现有全部浏览器都支持 WASM，包括谷歌 Chrome、苹果 Safari、微软 Edge、Firefox 等。 </p>\n<p>更直观地说，WASM 可以让较为复杂的应用，兼容各个浏览器，且流畅运行。 例如，Google Earth（谷歌地球）可以在 Firefox 浏览器上流畅运行（注意“流畅”），WASM 起到了关键作用。 跨平台 OpenGL 图形引擎 Magnum、知名 HTML5 游戏引擎 Egret Engine 等等，也都利用 WASM 兼容浏览器版本，并提升性能。 </p>\n<p>所以，如果使用 WASM 编写 Web3 钱包，理论上是可以在 Safari 等不同浏览器上使用 Metamask 这类钱包应用的。</p>\n<p>而且，可以让 Web3 领域，一些使用 Web 作为前端的 DApp，更流畅地跨多个浏览器部署。 </p>\n<p>可以说，WASM 生态系统是一个融合 Web2 的、比当前 Web3 生态更庞大的系统。 而 zk-WASM，是通过使用 ZK 电路编写 WASM，将 ZK 与 WASM 优点结合，使 WASM 具有去信任化、去中心化等 Web3 特点。 </p>\n<p>将 WASM 与 ZK 相结合的意义在于，让 Web3 应用更易用、更流畅，让已经对传统互联网浏览器使用习惯了的用户，可以更容易地接触到 Web3，进入Web3，真正让 Web3 触及1亿，乃至10亿用户。</p>\n<h3 id=\"关于-zprize\">关于 ZPrize</h3>\n<p>ZPrize 是 Manta Network 联合21家业内公司与机构联合发起的、旨在推动 ZK 技术大规模采用的竞赛计划，得到了以太坊基金会、AMD、Matter Labs（zkSync 开发团队）。</p>\n<p>其中，Manta Network 与 Polkadot Pioneers Prize 等共同设立75万美元挑战奖项，致力于解决多变量乘法（MSM)，这也是零知识计算的重要组成部分。 该奖项将侧重于最大限度地提高客户端和虚拟机上的吞吐量/最小化延迟，特别是 WebAssembly（WASM）的运行时间。</p>\n<p>Manta Network 创始人 Shumo 将 WASM ZKP 性能视为 ZKP 大规模采用的“最后一英里问题”。 12月7日，ZPrize 公布参赛获奖名单，Manta Network 与 Jump 合作的《Accelerating Elliptic

By only including the code that is needed for a specific application, you can avoid the overhead of unused or unnecessary code.</p><p>Though there are compiler optimizations to remove dead code, still, this can result in faster and more efficient programs (and make the compiler’s life easier).</p><h3>Size</h3><p>The overall size of the resulting binary is influenced by which dependencies you include and how you use them.</p><p>Feature selection can help the resulting binary be smaller, benefiting applications that need to be distributed or deployed to resource-constrained environments.</p><h3>Maintainability</h3><p>I’ve recently had a breaking upstream dependency, where I was lucky enough to have that upstream breaking code under a feature flag — for a feature I was not using.</p><p>While waiting for the upstream library to update, I removed the feature for my local project, which was building fine again. This means you can improve Rust code&#39;s maintainability by allowing developers to include or exclude specific functionality selectively.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>Statistically speaking — the more code you depend on, the higher the chance of a security issue. Depending on only the features you need to lower the odds of a security issue is security-by-design thinking, and a crate that offers itself “in chunks” is helping that happen.</p><p>There are also ways to select different implementations of the same functionality based on how comfortable you are with the safety of an implementation. For example, you might prefer a Rust-native TLS implementation over a C-based one because Rust is a safe language, and some <a href=\"https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L29-L44\">crates like Reqwest</a> offer a selection of TLS backends.</p><h3>Portability</h3><p>As a compiled language, an important aspect of feature flags is improving your code&#39;s portability.</p><p>You can selectively include or exclude specific functionality to make your code more portable across different platforms and environments.</p><h3>How Does C/C++ Compare?</h3><p>C and C++ have historically been the archetypes of compiled portable code deployed to many platforms and CPU architectures.</p><p>C++ does not have a built-in feature directly equivalent to the ability to pick compile time features in Rust. However, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4469645/dos-and-donts-of-conditional-compile\">C++ does have a number of preprocessor directives</a> that can be used to include or exclude certain code at compile time selectively.</p><p>This can provide some of the same benefits as feature flags in Rust. Still, it’s messy and hard to discover — both as a programmer looking to build into an existing codebase and as a consumer looking to enable or disable features.</p><h3>Feature Flags: The Building Blocks</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*UaMeKqJ5mFql7bkx1IRKlg.png\" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>To enable a specific feature flag for a specific crate, you can use the default-features = false and features attributes in the crate&#39;s Cargo.toml file.</p><p>For example:</p><pre>[dependencies]<br>my-crate = { default-features = false, features = [&quot;my-feature&quot;] }</pre><p>To enable a feature flag for a specific piece of code, you can use the #[cfg(feature = &quot;my-feature&quot;)] attribute. For example:</p><pre>#[cfg(feature = &quot;my-feature&quot;)]<br>fn my_function() {<br>    // Code that is only included when the &quot;my-feature&quot; flag is enabled<br>}</pre><p>To enable a feature flag for a specific module, you can use the #[cfg(feature = &quot;my-feature&quot;)] attribute on the mod declaration. For example:</p><pre>#[cfg(feature = &quot;my-feature&quot;)]<br>mod my_module {<br>    // Code that is only included when the &quot;my-feature&quot; flag is enabled<br>}</pre><p>To enable a feature flag for a specific struct or enum with derive, you can use the #[cfg_attr(feature = &quot;my-feature&quot;, derive(...))] attribute. For example:</p><pre>#[cfg_attr(feature = &quot;my-feature&quot;, derive(Debug, PartialEq))]<br>struct MyStruct {<br>    // Fields and methods that are only included when the &quot;my-feature&quot; flag is enabled<br>}</pre><p>Here’s how to enable or disable support for a specific platform:</p><pre>#[cfg(target_os = &quot;linux&quot;)]<br>mod linux_specific_code {<br>    // Linux-specific code goes here...<br>}</pre><p>And how to enable or disable a specific implementation of a trait:</p><pre>#[cfg(feature = &quot;special_case&quot;)]<br>impl MyTrait for MyType {<br>    // Implementation of trait for special case goes here...<br>}</pre><p>How to enable or disable a specific test case:</p><pre>#[cfg(feature = &quot;expensive_tests&quot;)]<br>#[test]<br>fn test_expensive_computation() {<br>    // Test that performs expensive computation goes here...<br>}</pre><p>Here’s the code to enable or disable a specific benchmark:</p><pre>#[cfg(feature = &quot;long_benchmarks&quot;)]<br>#[bench]<br>fn bench_long_running_operation(b: &amp;mut Bencher) {<br>    // Benchmark for a long-running operation goes here...<br>}</pre><p>To enable a feature only when multiple flags are set, you can use the #[cfg(all(feature1, feature2, ...))] attribute. For example, to enable a my_function() only when both the my_feature1 and my_feature2 flags are set:</p><pre>#[cfg(all(feature = &quot;my_feature1&quot;, feature = &quot;my_feature2&quot;))]<br>fn my_function() {<br>    // code for my_function<br>}</pre><p>To enable a feature only when one of the multiple flags is set, you can use the #[cfg(any(feature1, feature2, ...))] attribute. For example, to enable a my_function() when either the my_feature1 or my_feature2 flag is set:</p><pre>#[cfg(any(feature = &quot;my_feature1&quot;, feature = &quot;my_feature2&quot;))]<br>fn my_function() {<br>    // code for my_function<br>}</pre><h3>Feature Flags Illustrated</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/538/1*ClPJZBSkuwEWmJN1xE-mSQ.png\" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>Same module, but point to a different path for implementation, then pull out a function to expose from that module with pub use.</p><pre>//!

By only including the code that is needed for a specific application, you can avoid the overhead of unused or unnecessary code.\nThough there are compiler optimizations to remove dead code, still, this can result in faster and more efficient programs (and make the compiler’s life easier).\nSize\nThe overall size of the resulting binary is influenced by which dependencies you include and how you use them.\nFeature selection can help the resulting binary be smaller, benefiting applications that need to be distributed or deployed to resource-constrained environments.\nMaintainability\nI’ve recently had a breaking upstream dependency, where I was lucky enough to have that upstream breaking code under a feature flag — for a feature I was not using.\nWhile waiting for the upstream library to update, I removed the feature for my local project, which was building fine again. This means you can improve Rust code's maintainability by allowing developers to include or exclude specific functionality selectively.\nSecurity\nStatistically speaking — the more code you depend on, the higher the chance of a security issue. Depending on only the features you need to lower the odds of a security issue is security-by-design thinking, and a crate that offers itself “in chunks” is helping that happen.\nThere are also ways to select different implementations of the same functionality based on how comfortable you are with the safety of an implementation. For example, you might prefer a Rust-native TLS implementation over a C-based one because Rust is a safe language, and some crates like Reqwest offer a selection of TLS backends.\nPortability\nAs a compiled language, an important aspect of feature flags is improving your code's portability.\nYou can selectively include or exclude specific functionality to make your code more portable across different platforms and environments.\nHow Does C/C++ Compare?\nC and C++ have historically been the archetypes of compiled portable code deployed to many platforms and CPU architectures.\nC++ does not have a built-in feature directly equivalent to the ability to pick compile time features in Rust. However, C++ does have a number of preprocessor directives that can be used to include or exclude certain code at compile time selectively.\nThis can provide some of the same benefits as feature flags in Rust. Still, it’s messy and hard to discover — both as a programmer looking to build into an existing codebase and as a consumer looking to enable or disable features.\nFeature Flags: The Building Blocks\nImage by author\nTo enable a specific feature flag for a specific crate, you can use the default-features = false and features attributes in the crate's Cargo.toml file.\nFor example:\n[dependencies]\nmy-crate = { default-features = false, features = [\"my-feature\"] }\nTo enable a feature flag for a specific piece of code, you can use the #[cfg(feature = \"my-feature\")] attribute. For example:\n#[cfg(feature = \"my-feature\")]\nfn my_function() {\n    // Code that is only included when the \"my-feature\" flag is enabled\n}\nTo enable a feature flag for a specific module, you can use the #[cfg(feature = \"my-feature\")] attribute on the mod declaration. For example:\n#[cfg(feature = \"my-feature\")]\nmod my_module {\n    // Code that is only included when the \"my-feature\" flag is enabled\n}\nTo enable a feature flag for a specific struct or enum with derive, you can use the #[cfg_attr(feature = \"my-feature\", derive(...))] attribute. For example:\n#[cfg_attr(feature = \"my-feature\", derive(Debug, PartialEq))]\nstruct MyStruct {\n    // Fields and methods that are only included when the \"my-feature\" flag is enabled\n}\nHere’s how to enable or disable support for a specific platform:\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nmod linux_specific_code {\n    // Linux-specific code goes here...\n}\nAnd how to enable or disable a specific implementation of a trait:\n#[cfg(feature = \"special_case\")]\nimpl MyTrait for MyType {\n    // Implementation of trait for special case goes here...\n}\nHow to enable or disable a specific test case:\n#[cfg(feature = \"expensive_tests\")]\n#[test]\nfn test_expensive_computation() {\n    // Test that performs expensive computation goes here...\n}\nHere’s the code to enable or disable a specific benchmark:\n#[cfg(feature = \"long_benchmarks\")]\n#[bench]\nfn bench_long_running_operation(b: &mut Bencher) {\n    // Benchmark for a long-running operation goes here...\n}\nTo enable a feature only when multiple flags are set, you can use the #[cfg(all(feature1, feature2, ...))] attribute. For example, to enable a my_function() only when both the my_feature1 and my_feature2 flags are set:\n#[cfg(all(feature = \"my_feature1\", feature = \"my_feature2\"))]\nfn my_function() {\n    // code for my_function\n}\nTo enable a feature only when one of the multiple flags is set, you can use the #[cfg(any(feature1, feature2, ...))] attribute. For example, to enable a my_function() when either the my_feature1 or my_feature2 flag is set:\n#[cfg(any(feature = \"my_feature1\", feature = \"my_feature2\"))]\nfn my_function() {\n    // code for my_function\n}\nFeature Flags Illustrated\nImage by author\nSame module, but point to a different path for implementation, then pull out a function to expose from that module with pub use.\n//!
