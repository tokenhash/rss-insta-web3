Data Pipeline is a customized data source, or “connector,” built on <a href=\"https://airbyte.com/\">Airbyte</a>, which provides an ELT approach allowing users to select which KYVE data set to extract, load it onto their preferred backend, then transform it in whatever or however many ways they need for their use case.

For those wanting to code their own solution for sourcing KYVE data, they can do so via the REST-API.</p><h3>Data Access Via REST-API</h3><p>The REST-API is a resource model outlining the major details you need to know about a given piece of data. For example, where and how it’s being stored. For KYVE, its data is available through the REST-API exposed by its chain nodes. This integration is a native way to access data in a completely trustless way via coding your own solution to get KYVE data (currently on testnet) onto your own application and or database. To get started, a list of REST endpoints can be found<a href=\"https://docs.kyve.network/developers/grpc.html#api-endpoint\"> here</a>.</p><p>Since KYVE stores data onto specialized providers and not natively on its own chain, developers must fetch the underlying data directly from the storage provider. The KYVE REST-API holds the proof that data on a storage provider is valid and can be retrieved trustless. A list of valid bundles is available at the kyve/query/v1beta1/finalized_bundles/[pool_id] path.</p><p>From this, the developer will get the storage_provider_id which points to a storage provider. In combination with the storage_id, developers can retrieve the uploaded data.</p><p>Some integrations might compress data before storing it on the storage provider. The compression_id indicates which compression method has been used.</p><p>Below displays the general workflow of this process:</p><pre>response = <br>requests.get(f”https://api.korellia.kyve.network/kyve/query/v1beta1/finalized_bundles/{pool_id_input}&quot;)<br>for bundle in response.json().get(“finalized_bundles”):<br>   storage_id = bundle.get(“storage_id”)<br><br>   # retrieve file from Arweave<br>   response_from_arweave = <br>requests.get(f”https://arweave.net/{storage_id}&quot;)<br>   decompressed = gzip.decompress(response_from_arweave.content)<br>   decompressed_as_json = json.loads(decompressed)</pre><p>After the data has been retrieved from the storage provider and decompressed, developers can use it in their applications.</p><h3>More Solutions to Come</h3><p>KYVE’s goal is to help build a secure, scalable, and trustless data infrastructure for all; therefore, our team is always looking for new ways to ease the data use and access experience. With new data risks and KYVE use cases popping up each day, KYVE is just getting started introducing new solutions to best benefit from its decentralized data lake.

His SECRET is, when asked pointed questions, he switches to market-plumbing speak, hiding behind lingo.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Let me help you understand SBF's moves.</p>\n  <p>:thread: :point_down:</p>\n  <p>\\</p>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Anytime you hear or read \"Alameda,\" replace with, \"Sam's personal account.\"</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  When Alameda borrows FTX customer money, that means \"Sam borrows customer money\": Alameda is 100% owned by Sam &amp; a few friends. Alameda had no clients. \"Alameda's capital\" is Sam's, Caroline's, etc.</p>\n  <p>:point_down:</p>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>Sam says he poorly \"risk-managed\" the FTX and Alameda relationship.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  Recall: Alameda=Sam. What transpired?</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Had Liquidity Issues</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • The Collateral Was Pretend Money</p>\n  <p>\\\n  3) Alameda (Sam) Had Issues:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Nobody has nailed down what happened: was Alameda *always* a fraud or did it suffer losses at some point and then get desperate (perhaps the Terra Luna implosion in the spring)?</p>\n  <p>\\\n  This is a question begging for an answer. I don't know, but…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true\">https://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4)…Sam claims he was no longer closely involved in Alameda (again, Alameda = Sam's personal capital). Sam claims Caroline &amp; Team ran it independently (other than its venture investments).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  This claim gives Sam cover to state he doesn't know the details about Alameda's issues.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  5) Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  At some point - time uncertain - Alameda (Sam) needed access to liquidity. It almost certainly had margin loans from 3rd parties being called (3rd parties like Gemini or Binance…maybe FTX?). To repay these, Alameda needed liquidity.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  6) To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  FTX client assets were the liquidity that Alameda (Sam) needed to repay its other loans. To pretend this was OK, FTX needed to hold collateral from Alameda as security against the loan (in case Alameda (Sam) didn't repay).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  7) When you borrow cash on margin, you generally have to post MORE collateral than you borrow.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Ex: you might borrow against your Schwab account. Schwab holds your account's assets as protection against you defaulting on the loan. This lets you turn investments into liquidity.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  8) Elon's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> margin loan is a prominent example:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of TSLA stock he posts (giving him cash to do anything, like buy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TWTR&src=cashtag_click\">$TWTR</a>, without selling TSLA).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  After borrowing from the facility, if TSLA stock falls below a certain threshold (say $1 to $3)…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  9)…Elon needs to either add more collateral to the margin facility (post more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a>) or pay down the loan.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  If he does neither, the lender can liquidate the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> it holds as collateral and repay the loan from the proceeds.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Now back to Alameda (Sam)…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  10) Together, FTX &amp; Alameda (Sam &amp; Sam) developed a few shitcoins…err \"tokens\": the most relevant are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a>.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Both FTX &amp; Alameda received huge grants of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a> (I'm just going to use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> going forward).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  F&amp;A (Sam) controlled the VAST majority of the issuance…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  11)…and only a tiny portion of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a> traded. Alameda was the largest trader. If you own 95% of something and then manipulate the price of the other 5%, you can make your 95% look REALLY valuable - just keep the price of that 5% up and look how valuable your 95% becomes!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://tenor.com/va2h.gif?embedable=true\">https://tenor.com/va2h.gif?embedable=true</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"12\">\n  <li>Guess what Alameda (Sam) used as collateral for those margin loans we were talking about? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a>.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  And it doesn't appear that FTX required a big haircut on those. Remember that Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> stock he posts? That's an 80% haircut. But…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  13)…it doesn't appear FTX required a substantial haircut on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> that Alameda (Sam) posted. Ultimately, using these shitcoins…I mean tokens, as collateral, Alameda (Sam) \"borrowed\" $9-$10 billion from FTX. That money was, almost by definition, FTX customer money.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  14) You might recall that Sam famously described tokens like these to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart\">@TheStalwart</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tracyalloway\">@tracyalloway</a> as \"magic money in a box.\" It was recognized immediately as Sam describing a Ponzi.

His SECRET is, when asked pointed questions, he switches to market-plumbing speak, hiding behind lingo.\n\\\n  Let me help you understand SBF's moves.\n:thread: :point_down:\n\\\n  \nAnytime you hear or read \"Alameda,\" replace with, \"Sam's personal account.\"\n\\\n  When Alameda borrows FTX customer money, that means \"Sam borrows customer money\": Alameda is 100% owned by Sam & a few friends. Alameda had no clients. \"Alameda's capital\" is Sam's, Caroline's, etc.\n:point_down:\nSam says he poorly \"risk-managed\" the FTX and Alameda relationship.\n\\\n  Recall: Alameda=Sam. What transpired?\n\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Had Liquidity Issues\n\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX\n\\\n  • To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX\n\\\n  • The Collateral Was Pretend Money\n\\\n  3) Alameda (Sam) Had Issues:\n\\\n  Nobody has nailed down what happened: was Alameda *always* a fraud or did it suffer losses at some point and then get desperate (perhaps the Terra Luna implosion in the spring)?\n\\\n  This is a question begging for an answer. I don't know, but…\nhttps://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true\n4)…Sam claims he was no longer closely involved in Alameda (again, Alameda = Sam's personal capital). Sam claims Caroline & Team ran it independently (other than its venture investments).\n\\\n  This claim gives Sam cover to state he doesn't know the details about Alameda's issues.\n\\\n  5) Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX:\n\\\n  At some point - time uncertain - Alameda (Sam) needed access to liquidity. It almost certainly had margin loans from 3rd parties being called (3rd parties like Gemini or Binance…maybe FTX?). To repay these, Alameda needed liquidity.\n\\\n  6) To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX:\n\\\n  FTX client assets were the liquidity that Alameda (Sam) needed to repay its other loans. To pretend this was OK, FTX needed to hold collateral from Alameda as security against the loan (in case Alameda (Sam) didn't repay).\n\\\n  7) When you borrow cash on margin, you generally have to post MORE collateral than you borrow.\n\\\n  Ex: you might borrow against your Schwab account. Schwab holds your account's assets as protection against you defaulting on the loan. This lets you turn investments into liquidity.\n\\\n  8) Elon's $TSLA margin loan is a prominent example:\n\\\n  Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of TSLA stock he posts (giving him cash to do anything, like buy $TWTR, without selling TSLA).\n\\\n  After borrowing from the facility, if TSLA stock falls below a certain threshold (say $1 to $3)…\n\\\n  9)…Elon needs to either add more collateral to the margin facility (post more $TSLA) or pay down the loan.\n\\\n  If he does neither, the lender can liquidate the $TSLA it holds as collateral and repay the loan from the proceeds.\n\\\n  Now back to Alameda (Sam)…\n\\\n  10) Together, FTX & Alameda (Sam & Sam) developed a few shitcoins…err \"tokens\": the most relevant are $FTT and $SRM.\n\\\n  Both FTX & Alameda received huge grants of $FTT and $SRM (I'm just going to use $FTT going forward).\n\\\n  F&A (Sam) controlled the VAST majority of the issuance…\n\\\n  11)…and only a tiny portion of $FTT / $SRM traded. Alameda was the largest trader. If you own 95% of something and then manipulate the price of the other 5%, you can make your 95% look REALLY valuable - just keep the price of that 5% up and look how valuable your 95% becomes!\nhttps://tenor.com/va2h.gif?embedable=true\nGuess what Alameda (Sam) used as collateral for those margin loans we were talking about? $FTT and $SRM.\n\\\n  And it doesn't appear that FTX required a big haircut on those. Remember that Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of $TSLA stock he posts? That's an 80% haircut. But…\n\\\n  13)…it doesn't appear FTX required a substantial haircut on the $FTT that Alameda (Sam) posted. Ultimately, using these shitcoins…I mean tokens, as collateral, Alameda (Sam) \"borrowed\" $9-$10 billion from FTX. That money was, almost by definition, FTX customer money.\n\\\n  14) You might recall that Sam famously described tokens like these to @TheStalwart and @tracyalloway as \"magic money in a box.\" It was recognized immediately as Sam describing a Ponzi. But most of us didn't realize *Sam* was issuing these magic tokens.\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=KZYqL79GDXU&t=1292s\n\\\n\n  \nSam may argue this is just how banks (and brokerages) work: they take deposits, they lend them out based on credit judgments to earn a spread, and - as long as depositors don't ask for deposits back en masse - all is perfectly fine.\n\\\n  But let me tell you what banks don't do:\n\\\n  16) Banks do not:\n\\\n  • Lend 70% of their deposits to one borrower\n\\\n  • Have that borrower be the founder of the bank\n\\\n  • Accept made-up \"tokens\" as collateral - the actual worst collateral ever conceived • Have almost all that collateral be just two (made up) assets\n\\\n  17)\n\\\n  • Apply de minimis haircuts to collateral\n\\\n  • Accept derivatives of the bank itself as collateral! $FTT is not random - it relates to FTX\n\\\n  As @matt_levine said, Goldman Sachs should not take $GS equity as collateral - it is circular risk. And definitely not pretend-GS equity.\n\\\n  18) This Collateral Was Pretend Money\n\\\n  Alameda (Sam) & FTX (also Sam) invented intrinsically worthless tokens, keeping almost all of it for themselves.

I am not an attorney, but these issues need to be addressed–at least within the culture that surrounds the use of these models, if not the legal system itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copyright protects outputs of creative processes, not inputs. You can copyright a work you produced, whether that’s a computer program, a literary work, music, or an image. There is a concept of “fair use” that’s most applicable to text, but still applicable in other domains. The problem with fair use is that it is never precisely defined. The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20fair%20use%20doctrine,news%20reporting%2C%20and%20scholarly%20reports.\" target=\"_blank\">US Copyright Office’s statement about fair use</a> is a model for vagueness:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Under the fair use doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is permissible to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and scholarly reports. There are no legal rules permitting the use of a specific number of words, a certain number of musical notes, or percentage of a work. Whether a particular use qualifies as fair use depends on all the circumstances.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We are left with a web of conventions and traditions. You can’t quote another work in its entirety without permission. For a long time, it was considered acceptable to quote up to 400 words without permission, though that number was never codified into law, and has been going down recently–and counting words applies poorly to software as well as works that aren’t written text. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20fair%20use%20doctrine,news%20reporting%2C%20and%20scholarly%20reports.\" target=\"_blank\">Elsewhere</a> the US copyright office states that fair use includes ”transformative” use, though “transformative” has never been defined precisely. It also states that copyright does not extend to ideas or facts, only to particular expressions of those facts–but we have to ask where the “idea” ends and where the “expression” begins. Interpretation of these principles will have to come from the courts, and the body of US case law on software copyright is surprisingly small–only 13 cases, according to the copyright office’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html\" target=\"_blank\">search engine</a>. Although the body of case law for music and other art forms is larger, it’s even less clear how these ideas apply. Just as quoting a poem in its entirety is a copyright violation, you can’t reproduce images in their entirety without permission. But how much of a song or a painting can you reproduce? Counting words isn’t just ill-defined, it is useless for works that aren’t made of words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These rules of thumb are clearly about outputs, rather than inputs: again, the ideas that go into an article aren’t protected, just the words. That’s where generative models present problems. Under some circumstances, output from Copilot may contain, verbatim, lines from copyrighted code. The legal system has tools to handle this case, even if those tools are imprecise. Microsoft is currently being <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/software/369456/github-copilot-sued-over-software-piracy-on-unprecendented-scale\" target=\"_blank\">sued for “software piracy”</a> because of GitHub. The case is based on outputs: code generated by Copilot that reproduces code in its training set, but that doesn’t carry license notices or attribution. It’s about Copilot’s compliance with the license attached to the original software. However, that lawsuit doesn’t address the more important question. Copilot itself is a commercial product that is built a body of training data, even though it is completely different from that data. It’s clearly “transformative.” In any AI application, the training data is at least as important to the final product as the algorithms, if not more important. Should the rights of the authors of the training data be taken into account when a model is built from their work, even if the model never reproduces their work verbatim? Copyright does not adequately address the inputs to the algorithm at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can ask similar questions about works of art. Andy Baio has a great <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://waxy.org/2022/11/invasive-diffusion-how-one-unwilling-illustrator-found-herself-turned-into-an-ai-model/\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> of an artist, Hollie Mengert, whose work was used to train a specialized version of Stable Diffusion. This model enables anyone to produce Mengert-like artworks from a textual prompt. They’re not actual reproductions; and they’re not as good as her genuine artworks–but arguably “good enough” for most purposes. (If you ask Stable Diffusion to generate “Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci,” you get something that clearly looks like Mona Lisa, but that would embarrass poor Leonardo.) However, users of a model can produce dozens, or hundreds, of works in the time Mengert takes to make one. We certainly have to ask what it does to the value of Mengert’s art. Does copyright law protect “in the style of”? I don’t think anyone knows. Legal arguments over whether works generated by the model are “transformative” would be expensive, possibly endless, and likely pointless. (One hallmark of law in the US is that cases are almost always decided by people who aren’t experts. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" target=\"_blank\">The Grotesque Legacy of Music as Property</a> shows how this applies to music.) And copyright law doesn’t protect the inputs to a creative process, whether that creative process is human or cybernetic. Should it? As humans, we are always learning from the work of others; “standing on the shoulders of giants” is a quote with a history that goes well before Isaac Newton used it. Are machines also allowed to stand on the shoulders of giants?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-973x1048.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14807\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-973x1048.png 973w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-279x300.png 279w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-768x827.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01.png 977w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px\" /><figcaption><br>Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci. DaVinci isn’t worried. (Courtesy Hugo Bowne-Anderson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To think about this, we need an understanding of what copyright does culturally. It’s a double-edged sword. I’ve written several times about how <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/01/on-pirates-and-piracy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Beethoven and Bach made use of popular tunes in their music</a>, in ways that certainly wouldn’t be legal under current copyright law. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" target=\"_blank\">Jazz</a> is full of artists quoting, copying, and expanding on each other. So is classical music–we’ve just learned to ignore that part of the tradition. Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart could easily have been sued for their appropriation of popular music (for that matter, they could have sued each other, and been sued by many of their “legitimate” contemporaries)–but that process of appropriating and moving beyond is a crucial part of how art works. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14811\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02.png 868w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02-300x261.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02-768x667.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" /><figcaption><br>J. S. Bach’s 371Choral Copyright Violations. He would have been in trouble if copyright as we now understand it had existed.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have to recognize the protection that copyright gives to artists. We lost most of Elizabethan theater because there was no copyright.&nbsp;Plays were the property of the theater companies (and playwrights were often members of those companies), but that property wasn’t protected; there was nothing to prevent another company from performing your play.&nbsp; Consequently, playwrights had no interest in publishing their plays. The scripts were, literally, trade secrets. We’ve probably lost at least one play by Shakespeare (there’s evidence he wrote a play called Love’s Labors Won); we’ve lost all but one of the plays of Thomas Kyd; and there are other playwrights known through playbills, reviews, and other references for whom there are no surviving works. Christopher Marlowe’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Faustus_(play)\" target=\"_blank\">Doctor Faustus</a>, the most important pre-Shakespearian play, is known to us through two editions, both published after Marlowe’s death, and one of those editions is roughly a third longer than the other. What did Marlowe actually write? We’ll never know. Without some kind of protection, authors had no interest in publishing at all, let alone publishing accurate texts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there’s a finely tuned balance to copyright, which we almost certainly haven’t achieved in practice. It needs to protect creativity without destroying the ability to learn from and modify earlier works. Free and open source software couldn’t exist without the protection of copyright–though without that protection, open source might not be needed. Patents were intended to play a similar role: to encourage the spread of information by guaranteeing that inventors could profit from their invention, limiting the need for “trade secrets.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copying works of art has always been (and still is) a part of an artist’s education. Authors write and rewrite each other’s works constantly; whole careers have been made tracing the interactions between John Milton and William Blake. Whether we’re talking about prose or painting, generative AI devalues traditional artistic technique (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/on-technique/\" target=\"_blank\">as I’ve argued</a>), though possibly giving rise to a different kind of technique: the technique of writing prompts that tell the machine what to create. That’s a task that is neither simple nor uncreative. To take Mona Lisa and go a step further than Da Vinci–or to go beyond facile imitations of Hollie Mengert–requires an understanding of what this new medium can do, and how to control it. Part of Google’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://bdtechtalks.com/2022/11/07/google-generative-ai-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">AI strategy</a> appears to be building tools that help artists to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://wordcraft-writers-workshop.appspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">collaborate</a> with AI systems; their goal is&nbsp; to enable authors to create works that are transformative, that do more than simply reproducing a style or piecing together sentences. This kind of work certainly raises questions of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/people/mike-loukides/\" target=\"_blank\">reproducibility</a>: given the output of an AI system, can that output be recreated or modified in predictable ways? And it might cause us to realize that the old cliche “A picture is worth a thousand words” significantly underestimates the number of words it takes to describe a picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we best protect creative freedom?&nbsp;Is a work of art something that can be “owned,” and what does that mean in an age when digital works can be reproduced perfectly, at will? We need to protect both the original artists, like Hollie Mengert, and those who use their original work as a springboard to go beyond. Our current copyright system does that poorly, if at all. (And the existence of patent trolls demonstrates that patent law hasn’t done much better.)&nbsp; What was originally intended to protect artists has turned into a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" target=\"_blank\">rent-seeking game in which artists who can afford lawyers monetize the creativity of artists who can’t</a>. Copyright needs to protect the input side of any generative system: it needs to govern the use of intellectual property as training data for machines. But copyright also needs to protect the people who are being genuinely creative with those machines: not just making more works “in the style of,” but treating AI as a new artistic medium. The finely tuned balance that copyright needs to maintain has just become more difficult. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be solutions outside of the copyright system. Shutterstock, which previously announced that they were removing all AI-generated images from their catalog, has announced a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2343953-shutterstock-will-sell-ai-generated-art-and-compensate-human-artists/\" target=\"_blank\">collaboration with OpenAI</a> that allow the creation of images using a model that has only been trained on images licensed to Shutterstock. Creators of the images used for training will receive a royalty based on images created by the model. Shutterstock hasn’t released any details about the compensation plan, and it’s easy to suspect that the actual payments will be similar to the royalties musicians get from streaming services: microcents per use. But their approach could work with the right compensation plan. Deviant Art has released <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.dreamup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DreamUp</a>, a model based on Stable Diffusion that allows artists to specify whether models can be trained on their content, along with identifying all of its outputs as computer generated. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/adobe-stock-begins-selling-ai-generated-artwork/\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> has just announced their own set of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/stock/contributor/help/generative-ai-content.html\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a> for submitting generative art to their Adobe Stock collection, which requiring that AI-generated art be labeled as such, and that the (human) creators have obtained all the licenses that might be required for the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These solutions could be taken a step further. What if the models were trained on licenses, in addition to the original works themselves? It is easy to imagine an AI system that has been trained on the (many) Open Source and Creative Commons licenses. A user could specify what license terms were acceptable, and the system would generate appropriate output–including licenses and attributions, and taking care of compensation where necessary.

I am not an attorney, but these issues need to be addressed–at least within the culture that surrounds the use of these models, if not the legal system itself.\nCopyright protects outputs of creative processes, not inputs. You can copyright a work you produced, whether that’s a computer program, a literary work, music, or an image. There is a concept of “fair use” that’s most applicable to text, but still applicable in other domains. The problem with fair use is that it is never precisely defined. The US Copyright Office’s statement about fair use is a model for vagueness:\nUnder the fair use doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is permissible to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and scholarly reports. There are no legal rules permitting the use of a specific number of words, a certain number of musical notes, or percentage of a work. Whether a particular use qualifies as fair use depends on all the circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nWe are left with a web of conventions and traditions. You can’t quote another work in its entirety without permission. For a long time, it was considered acceptable to quote up to 400 words without permission, though that number was never codified into law, and has been going down recently–and counting words applies poorly to software as well as works that aren’t written text. Elsewhere the US copyright office states that fair use includes ”transformative” use, though “transformative” has never been defined precisely. It also states that copyright does not extend to ideas or facts, only to particular expressions of those facts–but we have to ask where the “idea” ends and where the “expression” begins. Interpretation of these principles will have to come from the courts, and the body of US case law on software copyright is surprisingly small–only 13 cases, according to the copyright office’s search engine. Although the body of case law for music and other art forms is larger, it’s even less clear how these ideas apply. Just as quoting a poem in its entirety is a copyright violation, you can’t reproduce images in their entirety without permission. But how much of a song or a painting can you reproduce? Counting words isn’t just ill-defined, it is useless for works that aren’t made of words.\nThese rules of thumb are clearly about outputs, rather than inputs: again, the ideas that go into an article aren’t protected, just the words. That’s where generative models present problems. Under some circumstances, output from Copilot may contain, verbatim, lines from copyrighted code. The legal system has tools to handle this case, even if those tools are imprecise. Microsoft is currently being sued for “software piracy” because of GitHub. The case is based on outputs: code generated by Copilot that reproduces code in its training set, but that doesn’t carry license notices or attribution. It’s about Copilot’s compliance with the license attached to the original software. However, that lawsuit doesn’t address the more important question. Copilot itself is a commercial product that is built a body of training data, even though it is completely different from that data. It’s clearly “transformative.” In any AI application, the training data is at least as important to the final product as the algorithms, if not more important. Should the rights of the authors of the training data be taken into account when a model is built from their work, even if the model never reproduces their work verbatim? Copyright does not adequately address the inputs to the algorithm at all.\nWe can ask similar questions about works of art. Andy Baio has a great discussion of an artist, Hollie Mengert, whose work was used to train a specialized version of Stable Diffusion. This model enables anyone to produce Mengert-like artworks from a textual prompt. They’re not actual reproductions; and they’re not as good as her genuine artworks–but arguably “good enough” for most purposes. (If you ask Stable Diffusion to generate “Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci,” you get something that clearly looks like Mona Lisa, but that would embarrass poor Leonardo.) However, users of a model can produce dozens, or hundreds, of works in the time Mengert takes to make one. We certainly have to ask what it does to the value of Mengert’s art. Does copyright law protect “in the style of”? I don’t think anyone knows. Legal arguments over whether works generated by the model are “transformative” would be expensive, possibly endless, and likely pointless. (One hallmark of law in the US is that cases are almost always decided by people who aren’t experts. The Grotesque Legacy of Music as Property shows how this applies to music.) And copyright law doesn’t protect the inputs to a creative process, whether that creative process is human or cybernetic. Should it? As humans, we are always learning from the work of others; “standing on the shoulders of giants” is a quote with a history that goes well before Isaac Newton used it. Are machines also allowed to stand on the shoulders of giants?\n\nMona Lisa in the style of DaVinci. DaVinci isn’t worried. (Courtesy Hugo Bowne-Anderson)\n\n\n\nTo think about this, we need an understanding of what copyright does culturally. It’s a double-edged sword. I’ve written several times about how Beethoven and Bach made use of popular tunes in their music, in ways that certainly wouldn’t be legal under current copyright law. Jazz is full of artists quoting, copying, and expanding on each other. So is classical music–we’ve just learned to ignore that part of the tradition. Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart could easily have been sued for their appropriation of popular music (for that matter, they could have sued each other, and been sued by many of their “legitimate” contemporaries)–but that process of appropriating and moving beyond is a crucial part of how art works. \n\nJ. S. Bach’s 371Choral Copyright Violations. He would have been in trouble if copyright as we now understand it had existed.\n\n\n\nWe also have to recognize the protection that copyright gives to artists. We lost most of Elizabethan theater because there was no copyright. Plays were the property of the theater companies (and playwrights were often members of those companies), but that property wasn’t protected; there was nothing to prevent another company from performing your play.  Consequently, playwrights had no interest in publishing their plays. The scripts were, literally, trade secrets. We’ve probably lost at least one play by Shakespeare (there’s evidence he wrote a play called Love’s Labors Won); we’ve lost all but one of the plays of Thomas Kyd; and there are other playwrights known through playbills, reviews, and other references for whom there are no surviving works. Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus, the most important pre-Shakespearian play, is known to us through two editions, both published after Marlowe’s death, and one of those editions is roughly a third longer than the other. What did Marlowe actually write? We’ll never know. Without some kind of protection, authors had no interest in publishing at all, let alone publishing accurate texts.\nSo there’s a finely tuned balance to copyright, which we almost certainly haven’t achieved in practice. It needs to protect creativity without destroying the ability to learn from and modify earlier works. Free and open source software couldn’t exist without the protection of copyright–though without that protection, open source might not be needed. Patents were intended to play a similar role: to encourage the spread of information by guaranteeing that inventors could profit from their invention, limiting the need for “trade secrets.”\nCopying works of art has always been (and still is) a part of an artist’s education. Authors write and rewrite each other’s works constantly; whole careers have been made tracing the interactions between John Milton and William Blake. Whether we’re talking about prose or painting, generative AI devalues traditional artistic technique (as I’ve argued), though possibly giving rise to a different kind of technique: the technique of writing prompts that tell the machine what to create. That’s a task that is neither simple nor uncreative. To take Mona Lisa and go a step further than Da Vinci–or to go beyond facile imitations of Hollie Mengert–requires an understanding of what this new medium can do, and how to control it. Part of Google’s AI strategy appears to be building tools that help artists to collaborate with AI systems; their goal is  to enable authors to create works that are transformative, that do more than simply reproducing a style or piecing together sentences. This kind of work certainly raises questions of reproducibility: given the output of an AI system, can that output be recreated or modified in predictable ways? And it might cause us to realize that the old cliche “A picture is worth a thousand words” significantly underestimates the number of words it takes to describe a picture.\nHow do we best protect creative freedom? Is a work of art something that can be “owned,” and what does that mean in an age when digital works can be reproduced perfectly, at will? We need to protect both the original artists, like Hollie Mengert, and those who use their original work as a springboard to go beyond. Our current copyright system does that poorly, if at all. (And the existence of patent trolls demonstrates that patent law hasn’t done much better.)  What was originally intended to protect artists has turned into a rent-seeking game in which artists who can afford lawyers monetize the creativity of artists who can’t. Copyright needs to protect the input side of any generative system: it needs to govern the use of intellectual property as training data for machines. But copyright also needs to protect the people who are being genuinely creative with those machines: not just making more works “in the style of,” but treating AI as a new artistic medium. The finely tuned balance that copyright needs to maintain has just become more difficult. \nThere may be solutions outside of the copyright system. Shutterstock, which previously announced that they were removing all AI-generated images from their catalog, has announced a collaboration with OpenAI that allow the creation of images using a model that has only been trained on images licensed to Shutterstock. Creators of the images used for training will receive a royalty based on images created by the model. Shutterstock hasn’t released any details about the compensation plan, and it’s easy to suspect that the actual payments will be similar to the royalties musicians get from streaming services: microcents per use. But their approach could work with the right compensation plan. Deviant Art has released DreamUp, a model based on Stable Diffusion that allows artists to specify whether models can be trained on their content, along with identifying all of its outputs as computer generated. Adobe has just announced their own set of guidelines for submitting generative art to their Adobe Stock collection, which requiring that AI-generated art be labeled as such, and that the (human) creators have obtained all the licenses that might be required for the work.\nThese solutions could be taken a step further. What if the models were trained on licenses, in addition to the original works themselves? It is easy to imagine an AI system that has been trained on the (many) Open Source and Creative Commons licenses. A user could specify what license terms were acceptable, and the system would generate appropriate output–including licenses and attributions, and taking care of compensation where necessary. We need to remember that few of the current generative AI tools that now exist can be used “for free.” They generate income, and that income can be used to compensate creators.\nUltimately we need both solutions: fixing copyright law to accommodate works used to train AI systems, and developing AI systems that respect the rights of the people who made the works on which their models were trained. One can’t happen without the other.","dc:creator":"Mike Loukides","comments":"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-does-copyright-say-about-generative-models/#respond","content":"The current generation of flashy AI applications, ranging from GitHub Copilot to Stable Diffusion, raise fundamental issues with copyright law.

While symbolic execution is a powerful technique that can augment the vulnerability discovery process, it requires some base domain knowledge and thus has its own learning curve. Given the plethora of ways in which a user can interact with such an engine and the need for frequent context switching between a disassembler and one’s terminal or script editor, integrating symbolic execution into one’s workflow can be daunting for a beginner.</p>\n<p>One of the ways Trail of Bits has sought to ease this process is by making graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Manticore that are embedded in popular interactive disassemblers. Last summer, former intern Alan Chang worked on the first such interface, <a href=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/11/17/mui-visualizing-symbolic-execution-with-manticore-and-binary-ninja/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Manticore User Interface (MUI) plugin for Binary Ninja</a>. We found that pairing Manticore directly with an interactive disassembler provides vulnerability researchers with a more convenient way to actually use (and benefit from) symbolic execution. Therefore, during my winter and summer internships at Trail of Bits, my goal was to help grow the MUI ecosystem by making a MUI plugin for Ghidra and building infrastructure to make these plugins easier to use, maintain, and develop.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103448\" style=\"width: 791px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103448\" data-attachment-id=\"103448\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/manitcore_chart/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=781%2C321&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"781,321\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Manitcore_chart\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=690%2C284&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-103448\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=690%2C284&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?w=781&amp;ssl=1 781w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=768%2C316&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103448\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.</p></div>\n<h2>The Ghidra Plugin</h2>\n<p>We figured that the most direct way to encourage more people to use MUI plugins would be to simply develop MUI plugins for a greater variety of disassemblers! Thus, I spent my winternship developing a Ghidra version of the MUI plugin; I chose Ghidra chiefly because it is popular and, unlike the commercial tool Binary Ninja, free and open source. Additionally, a few internal projects at Trail of Bits were already using Ghidra, so I would have ample opportunity to explore Ghidra plugin development. Finally, by developing a Ghidra plugin (one written in Java instead of Python), we could develop a solution that wouldn’t be tied to a single programming language, gaining insight that could guide the development of future plugins.</p>\n<p>This initial Ghidra plugin mimicked the existing Binary Ninja plugin as closely as possible. While it took a bit of time to become familiar with Java Swing and Ghidra’s widgets, simply mimicking the existing visual components and user interface was a fairly trivial task once I got going.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103450\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103450\" data-attachment-id=\"103450\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4-06-25-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=1240%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1240,416\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 4.06.25 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;A side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=300%2C101&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=690%2C232&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=690%2C232&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=1024%2C344&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=300%2C101&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=768%2C258&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=1200%2C403&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?w=1240&amp;ssl=1 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.</p></div>\n<p>However, because the Ghidra plugin would be written in Java, it could not depend on the Manticore Python package or directly call Manticore’s Python API. Our solution to that challenge was to use a tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/linkedin/shiv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shiv</a> to seamlessly bundle the Manticore library and all of its dependencies into a <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0441/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python zipapp</a>. That way, we could create a “batteries-included” Manticore binary and then translate the Binary Ninja plugin’s interactions with the Manticore API into the appropriate command-line arguments. We then placed this binary in the relevant platform-specific subdirectories of Ghidra’s <code>os</code> directory, which facilitates cross-platform support.</p>\n<p>By the end of the winternship, I was able to add extra features to the Ghidra plugin, such as the ability to specify arbitrary Manticore arguments in addition to those with dedicated input fields and support for multiple Manticore instances in the same Ghidra session. This, however, brought to light an additional problem.</p>\n<h2>Feature parity and cross-disassembler development</h2>\n<p>It quickly became apparent that our approach to plugin development would not be sustainable if we aspired to expand the MUI project to support even more disassemblers. For each new MUI feature, we would first have to determine how to implement the feature, accounting for the way that the plugin interacts with Manticore (e.g., through direct calls to the Manticore API or through Manticore’s command-line interface options). Furthermore, certain front-end information shared across plugins (e.g., fixed description strings or sensible default options) would have to be repeated and standardized in each implementation.</p>\n<p>To address this problem, over the summer I developed a centralized remote procedure call (RPC) server binary for MUI. This server handles all interactions with the full-featured Manticore Python API and handles MUI functionality through individual RPCs defined in a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protocol buffer</a>. We chose to use <a href=\"https://grpc.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gRPC</a> as our RPC framework because of its performance, wide adoption, and strong support for code generation across many programming languages. As a result, MUI plugins of the future can easily contain and depend on their own gRPC-generated code.</p>\n<p>The server is written in Python, providing it access to the full functionality of Manticore’s Python API, but is bundled into a shiv binary that can be called in any language. This facilitates a new client-server architecture that allows developers to implement any back-end Manticore functionality and tests just once. Developers of the front-end disassembler plugins can make RPC requests to the server with just a few lines of trivial code, which means that their work on individual plugins can focus almost entirely on front-end/UI changes.</p>\n<p>To alleviate the “chore” of handling fixed strings and other front-end information that will be identical across plugins, we can store such data in JSON files that are packaged with MUI plugin releases and loaded on startup. In this way, we can standardize data such as the fields, field descriptors, and default values of the run dialogs used to start Manticore’s execution.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103454\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103454\" data-attachment-id=\"103454\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/fixed_data/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=1600%2C1159&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1159\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fixed_data\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Fixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=690%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103454\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=690%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1024%2C742&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=768%2C556&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1536%2C1113&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1200%2C869&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.</p></div>\n<h2>Demo: Developing a Feature for MUI</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the process of developing a feature for MUI. Suppose that we want to enable manual state management during the runtime of a Manticore instance. Specifically, we want the ability to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pause</strong> a state and <strong>resume</strong> it at a later time, which will be useful if we implement capabilities like execution tracing in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Kill</strong> a state at our discretion. That way, if a state bypasses an <code>avoid</code> hook or becomes stuck in an infinite loop, we will be able to abandon it.First, we will define a new RPC and the RPC’s message formats in our protocol buffer file. The server will receive the state’s numeric ID, the Manticore instance that we’re working with, and a <code>StateAction</code> enum indicating whether it should resume, pause, or kill the state.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_103456\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103456\" data-attachment-id=\"103456\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/rpc_details/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=1534%2C1124&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1534,1124\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"RPC_details\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Details of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=690%2C505&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103456\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=690%2C505&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=1024%2C750&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=768%2C563&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=1200%2C879&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?w=1534&amp;ssl=1 1534w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103456\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Details of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.</p></div>\n<p>We’ll also need to update an existing message—<code>ManticoreStateList</code>.

In our plugins, we encapsulate all such “connector” functions in a single file. In the Ghidra plugin, writing a connector function involves only three steps. First, we create a <code>StreamObserver</code> object to asynchronously handle RPC responses. In this case, we need only implement behavior for handling error cases, since the “results” of successful <code>ControlState</code> RPCs will be available to the user via the <code>GetStateList</code> RPC. Then we build the <code>ControlStateRequest</code> object, populating the fields as required. Lastly, we actually execute the RPC through a method exposed by the gRPC-generated <code>ManticoreServerStub</code>, which conveniently handles all communication with the server for us.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103468\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103468\" data-attachment-id=\"103468\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/connector_method/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=1600%2C1474&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1474\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"connector_method\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=690%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103468\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=690%2C635&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"635\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1024%2C943&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=768%2C708&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1536%2C1415&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1200%2C1106&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103468\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.</p></div>\n<p>The only thing left to do is to make the appropriate UI changes!

While symbolic execution is a powerful technique that can augment the vulnerability discovery process, it requires some base domain knowledge and thus has its own learning curve. Given the plethora of ways in which a user can interact with such an engine and the need for frequent context switching between a disassembler and one’s terminal or script editor, integrating symbolic execution into one’s workflow can be daunting for a beginner.\nOne of the ways Trail of Bits has sought to ease this process is by making graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Manticore that are embedded in popular interactive disassemblers. Last summer, former intern Alan Chang worked on the first such interface, the Manticore User Interface (MUI) plugin for Binary Ninja. We found that pairing Manticore directly with an interactive disassembler provides vulnerability researchers with a more convenient way to actually use (and benefit from) symbolic execution. Therefore, during my winter and summer internships at Trail of Bits, my goal was to help grow the MUI ecosystem by making a MUI plugin for Ghidra and building infrastructure to make these plugins easier to use, maintain, and develop.\n\nThe gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.\n\nThe Ghidra Plugin\nWe figured that the most direct way to encourage more people to use MUI plugins would be to simply develop MUI plugins for a greater variety of disassemblers! Thus, I spent my winternship developing a Ghidra version of the MUI plugin; I chose Ghidra chiefly because it is popular and, unlike the commercial tool Binary Ninja, free and open source. Additionally, a few internal projects at Trail of Bits were already using Ghidra, so I would have ample opportunity to explore Ghidra plugin development. Finally, by developing a Ghidra plugin (one written in Java instead of Python), we could develop a solution that wouldn’t be tied to a single programming language, gaining insight that could guide the development of future plugins.\nThis initial Ghidra plugin mimicked the existing Binary Ninja plugin as closely as possible. While it took a bit of time to become familiar with Java Swing and Ghidra’s widgets, simply mimicking the existing visual components and user interface was a fairly trivial task once I got going.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.\n\nHowever, because the Ghidra plugin would be written in Java, it could not depend on the Manticore Python package or directly call Manticore’s Python API. Our solution to that challenge was to use a tool called shiv to seamlessly bundle the Manticore library and all of its dependencies into a Python zipapp. That way, we could create a “batteries-included” Manticore binary and then translate the Binary Ninja plugin’s interactions with the Manticore API into the appropriate command-line arguments. We then placed this binary in the relevant platform-specific subdirectories of Ghidra’s os directory, which facilitates cross-platform support.\nBy the end of the winternship, I was able to add extra features to the Ghidra plugin, such as the ability to specify arbitrary Manticore arguments in addition to those with dedicated input fields and support for multiple Manticore instances in the same Ghidra session. This, however, brought to light an additional problem.\nFeature parity and cross-disassembler development\nIt quickly became apparent that our approach to plugin development would not be sustainable if we aspired to expand the MUI project to support even more disassemblers. For each new MUI feature, we would first have to determine how to implement the feature, accounting for the way that the plugin interacts with Manticore (e.g., through direct calls to the Manticore API or through Manticore’s command-line interface options). Furthermore, certain front-end information shared across plugins (e.g., fixed description strings or sensible default options) would have to be repeated and standardized in each implementation.\nTo address this problem, over the summer I developed a centralized remote procedure call (RPC) server binary for MUI. This server handles all interactions with the full-featured Manticore Python API and handles MUI functionality through individual RPCs defined in a protocol buffer. We chose to use gRPC as our RPC framework because of its performance, wide adoption, and strong support for code generation across many programming languages. As a result, MUI plugins of the future can easily contain and depend on their own gRPC-generated code.\nThe server is written in Python, providing it access to the full functionality of Manticore’s Python API, but is bundled into a shiv binary that can be called in any language. This facilitates a new client-server architecture that allows developers to implement any back-end Manticore functionality and tests just once. Developers of the front-end disassembler plugins can make RPC requests to the server with just a few lines of trivial code, which means that their work on individual plugins can focus almost entirely on front-end/UI changes.\nTo alleviate the “chore” of handling fixed strings and other front-end information that will be identical across plugins, we can store such data in JSON files that are packaged with MUI plugin releases and loaded on startup. In this way, we can standardize data such as the fields, field descriptors, and default values of the run dialogs used to start Manticore’s execution.\n\nFixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.\n\nDemo: Developing a Feature for MUI\nLet’s take a look at the process of developing a feature for MUI. Suppose that we want to enable manual state management during the runtime of a Manticore instance. Specifically, we want the ability to do the following:\nPause a state and resume it at a later time, which will be useful if we implement capabilities like execution tracing in the future.\nKill a state at our discretion. That way, if a state bypasses an avoid hook or becomes stuck in an infinite loop, we will be able to abandon it.First, we will define a new RPC and the RPC’s message formats in our protocol buffer file. The server will receive the state’s numeric ID, the Manticore instance that we’re working with, and a StateAction enum indicating whether it should resume, pause, or kill the state.\n\nDetails of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.\n\nWe’ll also need to update an existing message—ManticoreStateList. MUI plugins have state lists that display all states and the status of each state; these lists are updated via a GetStateList RPC. Because it’d be beneficial for users to see “paused” states as distinct from preexisting state statuses, we’ll add a new paused_states field to the RPC’s response message, which will contain a list of the states paused by the user.\n\nThe existing ManticoreStateList message is updated with a new paused_states attribute.\n\nWith that, we can proceed to generate the Python service interface code and mypy type stubs! During my summer internship, I used the command runner just to abstract away this work for developers, so we can run the just generate command to…just generate the required code!\nNow we can move on to implementing the back-end functionality. This code is contained in a single Servicer class in which each method represents an individual RPC.\nWe’ll begin by validating the RPC request data. While gRPC-generated code can check that the fields provided to it are correctly typed, it cannot enforce the use of any fields or verify that fields are well formed. Thus, we’ll write our own checks to assert the validity of the request; we’ll also set an error code and error details to be returned to the requester if the request is invalid.\n\nCode added to the back-end server validates the incoming RPC request.\n\nFinally, we can implement the state-pausing and state-killing functionality by directly accessing Manticore’s Python API. This direct access provides us far more control than we’d have if we were interacting with Manticore through its command-line options, enabling us to create a dummy busy state or abandon a specific state, for example. If all goes well, the front-end plugin will receive an empty response, which will be populated with the default OK status code.\n\nOnce the state has been successfully processed, an empty response object is returned.\n\nOne additional benefit of our approach is that we can write tests for our RPCs without having to deal with spawning up a server and connecting to it. Instead, we can simply call the Servicer’s methods directly and pass in a new Context object, which we can later inspect for error codes.\n\nWriting tests is as simple as directly calling the Servicer’s methods.\n\nOnce we’re done, we can use our trusty command runner to “just build” the shiv binary, which will give us a fresh server binary that we can use in our plugins.\nFirst, we need to generate the Java service interface code, which will be based on the updated protocol buffer. gRPC maintains a Java library, grpc-java, that will handle this for us.\nThen, we have to write the function that actually executes the RPC. In our plugins, we encapsulate all such “connector” functions in a single file. In the Ghidra plugin, writing a connector function involves only three steps. First, we create a StreamObserver object to asynchronously handle RPC responses. In this case, we need only implement behavior for handling error cases, since the “results” of successful ControlState RPCs will be available to the user via the GetStateList RPC. Then we build the ControlStateRequest object, populating the fields as required. Lastly, we actually execute the RPC through a method exposed by the gRPC-generated ManticoreServerStub, which conveniently handles all communication with the server for us.\n\nThe new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.\n\nThe only thing left to do is to make the appropriate UI changes! For this feature, we can simply open a context menu by right-clicking on a state in the state list and then populate the state with the actions that call the controlState method!\n\nThe added code creates a new option in the context menu and calls the “connector” method when that new option is selected.\n\n\nWith the Manticore functionality handled by the gRPC server, the UI changes that we must implement on the “front ends” of the Ghidra and Binary Ninja plugins are fairly straightforward.\n\nThe “hypothetical” state management feature discussed in the demo has actually been implemented and is now part of MUI! If you’re interested in seeing all of the changes and commits, check out the pull requests for the server and the Ghidra plugin. ( These pull requests were made before a refactor of where this code lives. The code now lives in the main Manticore repository under the server directory.)\nA Quick Step-by-Step Guide\nTo summarize, the steps for adding a new feature to MUI are as follows:\nStart by modifying the MUI Server binary.\nEdit the protocol buffer (the ManticoreServer.proto file) if new RPCs or modifications to existing messages are required.\nGenerate service interface code for the server script by running the just generate command.\nAdd the functionality and the request validation code to the server script (manticore_server.py), through which one can interact with the Manticore API directly.\nWhere applicable, write tests for the new functionality.\nBuild the shiv server executable by running the just build command.\nThen, for each front-end plugin:\nUse / copy over the new server binary;\nGenerate service interface code in the programming language used by the plugin; and\nMake any relevant front-end changes (and, where applicable, share standardized data as part of MUI’s common resources).\nConclusion\nMy internships at Trail of Bits have been really fulfilling, and I’m proud of how the MUI project has progressed.

Hash rate had grown throughout the summer as publicly-traded Bitcoin miners continued to add capacity via mining rigs pre-ordered during the bull market.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"731\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:731,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em><a href=\"https://charts.coinmetrics.io/formulas/#5041\">Source: Coin Metrics Network Data Pro</a></em></p><p>There&#8217;s a potentially interesting explanation behind the late September and October rise in hash rate: <a href=\"https://coinmetrics.io/special-insights/ethereum-merge/\">The Ethereum Merge</a>.

These \"one-hop\" addresses are typically controlled by individual miners contributing hash power to their mining pool of choice. Active miner addresses tend to peak just after Bitcoin price has topped, with slow-moving hardware deployments arriving late to the party as speculative enthusiasm begins to dwindle. Five months after the BTC price peaked in December 2017, monthly active miner addresses tipped 80,000, only to crash to lows near 10,000 in 2020.</p><p>This bull cycle, we didn't see nearly the same level of mining mania reflected in active addresses, potentially due to the consolidation of hash power into a smaller set of publicly-traded entities. However, in 2022 we've still seen the number of active mining addresses fall more than 50% from recent highs, reaching the lowest levels since 2011. Miner active addresses appeared to find a bottom in August, bouncing weakly back over the past few months, but activity could easily decline in December as major miners continue to file for bankruptcy.</p><p>Though the mining industry has matured significantly in the past few years, the continued trend of cyclical capitulation indicates the sector has some progress to make on proper risk management. While power-purchasing agreements enable miners to control exposure to rising energy prices, options for managing exposure to hashprice&#8212; a metric measuring USD-denominated revenue per unit of hashrate&#8212; are slim to none. To this end, mining service providers like Luxor Technologies have developed derivatives products for more sophisticated operations, allowing miners to hedge their exposure by selling hashprice <a href=\"https://hashrateindex.com/blog/luxor-technologies-launches-otc-bitcoin-mining-derivative/\">Non-Deliverable Forward</a> (NDF) contracts.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"704\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em><a href=\"https://luxor.tech/derivatives\">Source: Luxor Technologies</a></em></p><p>In the example scenario pictured above, a miner could use Luxor's NDF contract to hedge against a month-over-month decline in hashprice. Normally, a drop in hashprice would simply result in a loss of revenue&#8212; however, if a miner sold 1,500 NDF contracts at $90 per PH/s/day, they'd effectively lock-in revenue at this threshold. Thirty days later, the miner settles the contract at a hashprice of $70 per PH/s/day, netting a $30K profit and offsetting a broader decline in mining revenue.</p><p>While Luxor's hashprice marketplace is still in its early stages, hashrate derivatives will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in managing miner risk, especially as the industry continues to attract capital allocators from more traditional sectors.</p><h3>Foundry Hammers the Competition</h3><p>With the collapse of Poolin and the unprecedented growth of the U.S. mining industry, Foundry USA Pool has aggressively expanded its share of the Bitcoin hashrate. While <a href=\"https://coinmetrics.substack.com/i/75132155/poolin-goes-off-the-deep-end\">the Poolin episode</a> serves as a healthy reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the mining pool ecosystem, the migration of hashrate has furthered the dominance of the top 3 mining pools, with Foundry, AntPool, and F2Pool collectively controlling well over 50% of market share. Foundry&#8217;s place in the top 3 is especially noteworthy, with the American mining pool overtaking the longstanding leadership of Asia-based pools at the beginning of 2022.</p><div

href=\"https://coinmetrics.io/atlas/\">Source: Coin Metrics ATLAS</a></em></p><p>Foundry&#8217;s lack of empty blocks serves as a testament to the pool&#8217;s block templating prowess. In the split seconds after a block is mined, mining pools scramble to assemble a new block template, selecting the highest-paying transactions for inclusion in their next attempt at solving the Proof-of-Work. During this short period, pools continue to throw off hashrate, meaning there&#8217;s a small chance of a block being mined before a transaction-bearing template is fully assembled.</p><p>So far in 2022, Foundry has constructed block templates quickly enough to beat the clock. With the <a href=\"https://braiins.com/stratum-v2\">upcoming release</a> of Stratum V2, however, individual miners will soon have the option of assembling their own templates, cutting mining pool-middlemen out of the transaction selection process. Whether this will affect the frequency of empty blocks&#8212; and how that will impact the mining pool landscape&#8212; still remains to be seen.</p><h3>Waves in the Mempool</h3><p>Through the latter half of 2022, the mempool has remained relatively muted, with the exception of a prolonged period of congestion in mid-November.

To catch up on our other quarterly mining reviews from this year, check out the links below.\nSOTN’s 2022 Quarterly Mining Specials: Q1, Q2, Q3 \nBitcoin hash rate continued to push higher throughout most of Q4 in spite of a subdued spot BTC price. Hash rate — a proxy for the total amount of computational effort securing the network — hit as high as 250 EH/s (quintillion hashes per second) in late October, an all-time high. Hash rate had grown throughout the summer as publicly-traded Bitcoin miners continued to add capacity via mining rigs pre-ordered during the bull market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics Network Data Pro\nThere’s a potentially interesting explanation behind the late September and October rise in hash rate: The Ethereum Merge. As independent crypto researcher Data Always has suggested, the end of Ethereum mining likely incentivized operators to repurpose industrial rack space, swapping out GPUs used to mine Ethereum with ASICs used to mine Bitcoin. It’s hard to put an exact figure on the magnitude of this resource reallocation, but Bitcoin hash rate grew quickly from 220 EH/s to 250 EH/s shortly after the completion of The Merge in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: “The Merge and crypto's electricity consumption” by Data Always\nHowever, with the price of spot BTC facing renewed downward pressure in the wake of FTX’s failures, hash rate has started to slide. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty — a network parameter that automatically adjusts every 2 weeks to keep block times in check — decreased by more than 7% recently (see first chart above), the biggest decrease since miners abruptly exited China in spring 2021. \nThe stagnation in hash rate is a sign that miners are facing a new round of challenges amid wary market conditions.\nSigns of Miner Capitulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Coin Metrics ATLAS & Reference Rates \nOne proxy we can use to monitor mining activity is the number of Bitcoin addresses receiving payouts directly from mining pools. These \"one-hop\" addresses are typically controlled by individual miners contributing hash power to their mining pool of choice. Active miner addresses tend to peak just after Bitcoin price has topped, with slow-moving hardware deployments arriving late to the party as speculative enthusiasm begins to dwindle. Five months after the BTC price peaked in December 2017, monthly active miner addresses tipped 80,000, only to crash to lows near 10,000 in 2020.\nThis bull cycle, we didn't see nearly the same level of mining mania reflected in active addresses, potentially due to the consolidation of hash power into a smaller set of publicly-traded entities. However, in 2022 we've still seen the number of active mining addresses fall more than 50% from recent highs, reaching the lowest levels since 2011. Miner active addresses appeared to find a bottom in August, bouncing weakly back over the past few months, but activity could easily decline in December as major miners continue to file for bankruptcy.\nThough the mining industry has matured significantly in the past few years, the continued trend of cyclical capitulation indicates the sector has some progress to make on proper risk management. While power-purchasing agreements enable miners to control exposure to rising energy prices, options for managing exposure to hashprice— a metric measuring USD-denominated revenue per unit of hashrate— are slim to none. To this end, mining service providers like Luxor Technologies have developed derivatives products for more sophisticated operations, allowing miners to hedge their exposure by selling hashprice Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Luxor Technologies\nIn the example scenario pictured above, a miner could use Luxor's NDF contract to hedge against a month-over-month decline in hashprice. Normally, a drop in hashprice would simply result in a loss of revenue— however, if a miner sold 1,500 NDF contracts at $90 per PH/s/day, they'd effectively lock-in revenue at this threshold. Thirty days later, the miner settles the contract at a hashprice of $70 per PH/s/day, netting a $30K profit and offsetting a broader decline in mining revenue.\nWhile Luxor's hashprice marketplace is still in its early stages, hashrate derivatives will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in managing miner risk, especially as the industry continues to attract capital allocators from more traditional sectors.\nFoundry Hammers the Competition\nWith the collapse of Poolin and the unprecedented growth of the U.S. mining industry, Foundry USA Pool has aggressively expanded its share of the Bitcoin hashrate. While the Poolin episode serves as a healthy reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the mining pool ecosystem, the migration of hashrate has furthered the dominance of the top 3 mining pools, with Foundry, AntPool, and F2Pool collectively controlling well over 50% of market share. Foundry’s place in the top 3 is especially noteworthy, with the American mining pool overtaking the longstanding leadership of Asia-based pools at the beginning of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics ATLAS\nInterestingly, Foundry has also managed to maintain its foothold as the dominant mining pool without mining a single empty block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics ATLAS\nFoundry’s lack of empty blocks serves as a testament to the pool’s block templating prowess. In the split seconds after a block is mined, mining pools scramble to assemble a new block template, selecting the highest-paying transactions for inclusion in their next attempt at solving the Proof-of-Work. During this short period, pools continue to throw off hashrate, meaning there’s a small chance of a block being mined before a transaction-bearing template is fully assembled.\nSo far in 2022, Foundry has constructed block templates quickly enough to beat the clock. With the upcoming release of Stratum V2, however, individual miners will soon have the option of assembling their own templates, cutting mining pool-middlemen out of the transaction selection process. Whether this will affect the frequency of empty blocks— and how that will impact the mining pool landscape— still remains to be seen.\nWaves in the Mempool\nThrough the latter half of 2022, the mempool has remained relatively muted, with the exception of a prolonged period of congestion in mid-November. A massive flood of 12-15 sat/vB transactions (allegedly due to a Binance cold wallet consolidation) resulted in a substantial spike in the average mining reward, with F2Pool netting over 0.73 BTC in transaction fees for a single block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics FARUM\nOf course, it wouldn't be a Bitcoin bear market without a bit of vicious community in-fighting about seemingly minor technical details. Casual users of Bitcoin likely haven’t even heard of Replace-by-Fee (RBF), a unique transaction type that allows users the option to re-broadcast a prior on-chain payment with a slightly higher fee.\nReplace-by-Fee was designed to help relieve mempool pressure in periods of congestion, allowing users to bump transactions up the priority queue in exchange for a slightly higher tip to miners. However, members of Bitcoin’s business community warn the feature is easy to abuse— users can also “reverse” 0-confirmation transactions by re-broadcasting a payment and substituting their own address as the recipient. For merchants unsuspectingly accepting malicious 0-conf transactions, this effectively amounts to a double-spend, increasing the risk of chargeback fraud.\nSince their introduction in 2016, RBF-enabled transactions have become increasingly common. However, with the controversial release of Bitcoin Core 24.0, Replace-by-Fee is now the default setting for node mempools. While this change has seen plenty of pushback from the merchant community, developers stand firmly behind the upgrade, arguing that 0-confirmations have never been safe to accept in the first place. If you want instant settlement, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is a better option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: txstats.coinmetrics.io\nIn any case, miners have little direct incentive to worry about the potential for Replace-by-Fee fraud. Higher fees simply boost miner’s bottom line, no matter where they come from. Nonetheless, the increased complexity of monitoring RBF transactions could also make block templating significantly more difficult, forcing miners to keep their finger on the pulse of the mempool more than ever before.\nBetter Hashing Days Ahead?\nMiners have had a tough year and a particularly hard Q4. Looking to 2023, there are plenty of outstanding questions that will dictate the direction of the Bitcoin mining industry beyond just the price of BTC. \nWith the expansion of the industry’s US footprint, mining is being analyzed differently by various jurisdictions. In November, New York enacted a first of its kind two-year moratorium on new mining operations in the state. Meanwhile, as Texas prepares for winter, the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) recently reported 1.7 gigawatts (GW) worth of Large Flexible Loads primarily composed of Bitcoin miners to help state grid operators manage periods of high demand. The interactions between miners and governments at the local, state, and possibly federal level could continue to accelerate in 2023. \nOn the operational side, miners will likely need to continue to monitor input costs in the face of higher industrial electricity rates. Large operators with competitive rates in advantageous locations optimizing over every variable are poised to succeed in this environment. Further maturation and technical upgrades next year could benefit the ecosystem, such as the impending launch of Stratum V2.\nThere are plenty of challenges, but in the face of it all miners continue to hash away, securing the chain while cleverly positioning operations for success and survival.\nCoin Metrics Updates\nThis week’s updates from the Coin Metrics team:\n\nJoin us on The Mining Pod on December 21st, where we’ll provide a recap of Bitcoin mining data in 2022.\n\nWe're excited to be growing our data and research-focused community on gm.xyz, come join the conversation!\n\nCheck out our market-data focused newsletter State of the Market, featuring weekly updates on market conditions and news across the crypto ecosystem.\n\nAs always, if you have any feedback or requests please let us know here.\nSubscribe and Past Issues\nCoin Metrics’ State of the Network, is an unbiased, weekly view of the crypto market informed by our own network (on-chain) and market data.\nIf you'd like to get State of the Network in your inbox, please subscribe here.

They were great for our business and even better for our understanding. Of course we expect every feature to boost usage, but we couldn’t have anticipated the growth yielded by those two features. And the correlation was easy to analyze: both features directly implement a vision of the P2P economy.</p><p>The P2P economy refers to disintermediated exchange, like creative people trading the fruits of their creativity — podcasts, videos, fanfic novels, 3D-printed cosplay accessories — with users for cash, without the intervention of banks, payment processors, or aggregators.</p><p>Each intermediary in an interaction induces friction and increases the distance from the desired experience, and they can’t help it. Banks have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Aggregation platforms have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Payment processors have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit.</p><p>Notice the pattern? While each intermediary claims to be giving users what they want, they’re actually serving different groups who want different things at the same time. That intermediaries always take a cut, induce friction, and increase the distance between people and experiences isn’t the result of bad management or evil intentions, it’s just the nature of the beast.</p><p>So why not create something far better for users? Let people interact directly, pay each other directly, exchange goods and services directly. There are even services out there — social networks, messaging services, content aggregators, gaming platforms — that would like to facilitate exchanges among their users, but they can’t because legacy intermediaries induce too much (financial, regulatory, UX) friction. Worse still, the centralization induced by these large data networks increases their power over each user and, therefore, increases the risk of abuse to all users.</p><p>The P2P economy isn’t some billionaire’s pipe dream; it describes a world where we’re closer to the experiences we value and to each other.

While both of those functions are in the Breez app, they feel like their own little self-contained interfaces, tailor-made for their respective purposes (or as close as we could get with the technological limitations of running a node on a phone).</p><p>But you can only cram so many activities and experiences into a <a href=\"https://medium.com/breez-technology/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-lightning-wallet-dc9ac46d32\">non-custodial Lightning payment app</a>. And however clever, charming, and good looking a team behind the payment app may be, they’re not necessarily best placed to devise new ways of applying P2P payments to new types of experience. We know how to make Lightning mobile and how to improve its UX, but when it comes to commerce, music, video streaming, or any other vertical solution, experts in those fields know better how to craft the best experience.</p><p>Indeed, the POS mode and the podcast player are just scratching the surface of what’s possible. We implemented them according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\">the KISS principle</a>. Though they have scaled remarkably and attracted thousands of new users, they’re basically demo versions implemented to showcase how people interface with the P2P economy.</p><p>Could others with fine-grained expertise of those and other kinds of experience come up with better ways to apply P2P money to P2P interaction? <em>Of course they could</em>. And would those better applications achieve scale that our neophyte, outsider attempts never could? <em>Absolutely</em>.</p><p>And that’s the point. The better we apply the tech, the closer people get to the experiences they want, the more they will use the tech, the faster Lightning will scale. The scale we’re aiming for is not X orders of magnitude; we’re shooting for a world where kids roll their eyes whenever an adult says “Back in the fiat days…”</p><p>Achieving scale is a matter of reducing friction, and multiple, tailor-made apps that apply Lightning technology optimally to life’s many worthwhile pursuits is the best way of minimizing friction and expanding the P2P economy. It’s not about making the best wallet that can do everything; it’s about adapting Lightning — the means — to whatever ends users want and whatever kind of experience they want in exchange.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*VAZ6woKIBYlUtlWA\" /><figcaption>(Image: <a href=\"https://singularityhub.com/2016/04/05/how-to-think-exponentially-and-better-predict-the-future/\">Alison E. Berman</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>LaaS Liberates Lightning</h3><p>Those who understand the technical requirements of running a non-custodial Lightning app will have realized already that adapting Lightning payments to any number of existing and yet-unimagined applications is incompatible with running a node in a single app. Lightning is far too technically demanding to scale the P2P economy as we have described it. Running the kind of always-on node required is an experience that few users, developers, creators, or vendors out there will relish.</p><p>We’re envisioning, inventing, and realizing <strong>Lightning as a Service </strong>(LaaS). LaaS is about using Lightning to remove friction from life, from the experiences we crave. The point isn’t to improve the user experience <em>in the app</em>, but to improve the users’ experience <em>of Lightning as a whole</em> that gives them more value in their lives.</p><p>And LaaS is doable. As Breez envisions it, LaaS has three major components, the first of which is in development, the second has an alpha set to launch in a couple of months, and the third exists already and just needs to scale:</p><h4>A Lightning SDK</h4><p>As it stands, anyone seeking to integrate Lightning payments to their existing business faces a steep learning curve. Accepting payments over Lightning requires them to run a node, secure liquidity with an LSP, manage fiat exchanges, perform swaps on and off the Bitcoin blockchain, manage a wallet, and so on. A non-custodial SDK would give P2P entrepreneurs and existing web utilities access to those functions without having to start from scratch.</p><p>With a well-designed SDK, developers will be able to select the Lightning functions they need from a menu and integrate them quickly and easily into their own applications. Instead of having to learn the Lightning tech stack, a Lightning SDK will let developers simply plug it into their own tech stacks.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-Sgz6UfiUL-LHU1s\" /></figure><h4>Hybrid architecture</h4><p>Lightning needs to be immediately available wherever and whenever people want to make payments. Locking a user’s functionality into a single app or on a single device would require the user to adapt to the technology, which is backwards. That’s friction.</p><p>At the same time, though, KYC friction and global, cross-market expansion requires a peer-to-peer, non-custodial solution. As soon as LSPs start acting like banks, regulators will start treating them like banks. That’s friction too.</p><p>The solution is a hybrid architecture based on <a href=\"https://medium.com/breez-technology/get-ready-for-a-fresh-breez-multiple-apps-one-node-optimal-ux-519c4daf2536\">sovereign remote nodes</a>, but that locates those nodes in the cloud rather than on users’ local devices. To deliver both optimal user sovereignty with a next-gen UX, we’ve partnered with Blockstream and their <a href=\"https://blog.blockstream.com/en-greenlight-by-blockstream-lightning-made-easy/\">Greenlight product</a>. Any service can access these nodes from any device, but as long as the users’ keys are locally stored, users maintain custody of their own funds, minimizing the operators’ regulatory profile.</p><p>P2P + minimal friction = scale.</p><h4>Decentralizing liquidity</h4><p>There is no credit on Lightning. The liquidity to settle any transaction needs to be preloaded onto the network. While this imposes a significant liquidity burden on those seeking to process users’ payments, it also presents the rich opportunity of a snowball effect: the more liquidity the network contains, the more transactions it can process, the more transaction fees the operators can collect, the more liquidity they have to invest in the network, and so on.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.lynalden.com/lightning-network/\">Lyn Alden</a> recently put it,</p><blockquote>Once there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of participants, and with larger average channel balances, then routing a payment from any arbitrary point to any other arbitrary point on the network becomes exponentially easier and more reliable.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xIHhDYxMFyFXI3iN\" /><figcaption>Ironically, snowballs are only possible when water is frozen, i.e. <em>not liquid</em>.

While he must be held accountable for his actions, the American public deserves to hear directly from the former CEO, Waters said. \nLawyers estimate up to one million FTX creditors around the world are impacted by its bankruptcy, although how many are US-based is unclear. \nWaters threatened Bankman-Fried with subpoena to front Congress  \nEarlier this month, Waters encouraged Bankman-Fried to testify before a Financial Services committee.\n“We appreciate that you’ve been candid in your discussions about what happened at FTX,” Waters tweeted. “Your willingness to talk to the public will help the company’s customers, investors and others.”\nBankman-Fried responded to Waters’ request two days later, where he said he’d testify once learning exactly what happened with FTX, but was uncertain if he’d be ready in time for the hearing.\nFollowing criticism for not outright serving Bankman-Fried a subpoena to testify, the US representative for California’s 43rd congressional district shot back, claiming one was “definitely on the table.” \nBankman-Fried later acquiesced, claiming he would appear virtually on Tuesday. “… As the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th,” he tweeted.\n\n\nLies are circulating @CNBC that I am not willing to subpoena @SBF_FTX. He has been requested to testify at the December 13th hearing. A subpoena is definitely on the table. Stay tuned.\n— Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) December 8, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the timing of his arrest — on the day before his supposed appearance before Congress — has industry watchers (and social media) wondering whether coincidence or coordination is to blame. \n“An arrest has always been suspected,” Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation told Blockworks in a statement. “What’s interesting is the timing — right before two Congressional hearings.”  \nThe speed at which authorities filed charges against Bankman-Fried, however, likely indicates regulators had received information from cooperating witnesses, the New York Times reported Monday citing sources familiar with the matter.\nThe SEC separately charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding FTX’s equity investors on Tuesday, of which around 80 were based in the US. Tuesday on Tuesday. They together contributed more than $1.1 billion to Bankman-Fried ventures, the SEC said, representing about 60% of all funds he’d raised.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nCan’t wait?

月 13 日，FTX 创始人SamBankman-Fried 被巴哈马警方正式逮捕。\n根据巴哈马官方的声明，美国司法部门已经正式对 SBF 提起刑事诉讼，巴哈马警方在收到美国正式通知后逮捕了 SBF，并将按照要求引渡他。美国纽约南区检察官办公室的推文也证实了这一点 ，并表示，即将公布起诉书。据纽约时报援引消息人士报道，FTX 创始人 SBF 被指控犯有电汇欺诈、电汇欺诈共谋、证券欺诈、证券欺诈共谋和洗钱罪。\n此前，SBF 频繁接受各大媒体采访，并流连于各类推特 Space，让不少人心生疑惑，为何 FTX 崩盘后， SBF 似乎安然无恙？\n尘埃逐渐落定。\n就在 SBF 被逮捕的前几天，深潮 TechFlow 通过视频采访了 SBF。那一天，SBF 似乎精神不错，久违地露出了多次笑容。在采访的过程中，他不断强调自己很懊悔，重复表示“我搞砸了”，表明自己想要“积极解决客户的问题”；但另一边，他又将矛头对准了 CZ 和负责破产清算的 FTX 现任 CEO 及团队。在他看来，CZ 是扣动扳机，最终导致 FTX 爆炸的人。\n值得一提的是，SBF 在采访中承认，过去他将很多的精力浪费在了媒体以及 FTX 的品牌建设上，没有专注于产品优化和风险管理，现在看来造成了很多问题。\n在采访的最后，我们问他，你最后悔的事情是什么？\n他表示，“后悔出事后的那段时间我不应该在媒体消失，我本可以做更多”。\n真相还是谣言？\n深潮 TechFlow：自 FTX 破产以来，三箭资本频繁发起对 Alameda 的指控， 称在 LUNA 崩溃的事件中，三箭资本是被 Alameda 集团所猎杀，最终导致了三箭资本失去了自身 LP 与债权人的全部资金，此外，《纽约时报》也报道，美国曼哈顿联邦检察官开始调查 Alameda 是否是 LUNA 崩盘的幕后黑手，你怎么回应这些指控，是 Alameda 猎杀了 LUNA 和三箭资本吗？\nSBF：绝对不是。虽然今年很多事情都搞砸了，我很懊悔，因为这些事情直接导致了 FTX 的破产，我无比难过，但并不是说所有的事情都是这个原因造成的。\n三箭资本的崩溃与我们没有关系，Terra 更和我们没有任何关系，某种程度上来说，三箭资本和 Alameda 有着类似的经历。杠杆多头头寸、市值下降、最终被清算，我为他们的经历感到同情和难过，为今年因市场下跌而受到伤害的所有人感到难过，但我不能认同他们散布谣言，试图把自己的问题归咎于他人的行为。\n我觉得他们都是聪明人，我真的难以置信，他们真的相信 Alameda 与他们的头寸有任何关系。市场崩溃了，这很直接，但这与我采取的行动没有任何关系，与 Alameda 没有任何关系，从我的角度来看，他们只是在寻找一个替罪羊，想为自己的问题找到别人来承担责任。\n深潮 TechFlow：在 FTX 事件发生过后，你不断坚称自己对 Alameda财务状况没有详细了解，导致不知情发生了资金混用的情况，但福布斯报道称，你两年整理了 5 张资产清单，对 Alameda 的财务理解精确到个位数，你如何看待报道的内容？\nSBF：我寄给福布斯的那份文件是为了回应关于我 Holdings（持股） 的问询。我发送给了他们一份 Summary（概要），有关于我的 Holding 和 Alameda 的 Holding，这给了我一部分信息，我也知道了 Alameda 的 Token Holdings 的一些信息，但我并没有完全卷入其中。\n我只是看了一下 Alameda 的那些未平仓保证金头寸，但没有涉及到所有头寸的详情，这导致我并没有对 Alameda 有任何详细的了解，包括实际的全部资产净值等，只是知道他们的一些资产是什么，直到最近出事了我才知道了全部。\n深潮 TechFlow：所以你只是知道具体的数据，但是不知道为什么？\nSBF：我只知道其中的一部分。比如我知道 Alameda 最大资产在哪，但我不知道他们的负债。我知道有哪些借款或贷款，或者他们在 FTX 上的仓位，主要的代币持有量，我期望知道更多，但是显然事实不是这样。\n深潮 Tech Flow：最近，金融时报（FT）曝光了 Alameda 和 FTX Ventures 累计接近 500 项投资的明细，总价值共计超过 50 亿美元，这些用于投资的钱来自于哪里？回头来看，里面的一些投资是否过于草率？\nSBF：进行这样的投资绝对是一个错误。虽然我认为其中许多投资本身是合理的，但 Alameda 的投资规模太大，大概最终有数十亿美元，这也是导致它长期处于多头头寸和缺乏流动性的部分原因，我绝对希望 Alameda 没有进行过规模那么大的投资。\n媒体与自我\n深潮 TechFlow：在推特上，很多人有一种不满的情绪，认为你“贿赂”了华尔街日报/彭博社等一众媒体，他们似乎淡化了 FTX 破产的危害和性质，FTX 的媒体策略是怎样的？\nSBF：媒体策略要看是出事前还是出事后。如果倒退到崩溃之前的一个月，很明显，我与媒体有很多接触。我相当积极地和媒体谈了很多，我的目标是尽可能地帮助大家，让人们了解加密货币生态系统中发生的事情，试图帮助向立法者和其他人进行宣传。\n但这其中，我的很多话成了反击我的素材。上个月 FTX 崩盘的时候，我也是这样做，我与记者交谈，说我的想法，并试图有所帮助，但是他们会认为这种崩溃与我有关。从那时起，我进入了一个不怎么与媒体交谈的时期。我很后悔这么做，因为那个时期的报道有点脱离现实。显然，我搞砸了很多事，这绝对是事实，媒体对此也有权对此进行报道，但也有很多阴谋论开始四处流传，而这些都是不真实的。而且这种说法都占据了上风，包括 Luna 和三箭资本的崩溃……这都与我无关，却在媒体报道中经常出现。\n*背景：近期，《金融时报》披露了 Alameda 的近 500 项投资组合，其中包括对多家媒体的投资。此外，知名加密媒体 The Block 披露其前任 CEO 曾秘密从 SBF 获得累计 4300 万美元贷款。\nSBF：崩盘发生时，我确实消失了一段时间。这意味着有一段时间我的声音没有被听到，当时我觉得这很合适。但现在回想起来，当时有很多疯狂的事情出现。但我知道，真相会以某种方式出现的，但是我当时应该积极回击那些不真实的东西。\n深潮 TechFlow：此前在媒体上， 你被宣传为“有效利他主义者”，如今，在大多数人看来，这只是一种人设包装，来进行伪装和欺骗。真实的 Sam 是怎样的，你有什么不变的信仰？\nSBF：我试图做对世界未来有利的事情，显然是这样。但我现在搞砸了，我知道我没有做出想象中应有的影响力。我深感遗憾，也永远无法解决这个问题，这将持久困扰我。但这是我一直在努力做的事情，也是我将继续努力做的事情。这很令人兴奋，但也确实造成了遗憾。我想做我认知中对世界有益的事情，这是不变的，虽然我做错了很多，但也是我一直努力的方向。\n深潮 Tech Flow：你是加密货币以及区块链的信徒么，还是在你看来，加密货币仅仅是你赚钱的工具？\nSBF：是的，我是一个忠实的信徒。当我第一次接触到加密货币时，它只是一个赚钱的工具。2017 年，我第一次开始交易，我不知道加密货币是什么，也不关心那么多，它只是一个我可以交易和赚钱的东西。但在我交易的第一年里，我学到了很多关于加密货币是什么的知识。我必须使用它，并在加密货币交易所间进行转移。在这个过程中，我了解了加密货币最初存在的原因。\n交易所的未来\n深潮 TechFlow：FTX 倒塌之后，Binance 的地位得到了加强，你怎么看待未来中心化交易所的发展，Binance 会一直一家独大么？\nSBF：好问题，我不确定会发生什么，但是显然 Binance 变得更强大了。在这一点上，他们拥有大部分的交易量。我与他们有分歧，对他们在 FTX 暴雷时所做的很多事情感到非常沮丧。不过，他们也建立了一个好的产品，他们的用户很喜欢使用币安，为此要给他们点赞。\n在这个市场上，有竞争是很重要的，如果垄断的话，不一定能看到真正的竞争或增长。防止垄断很重要，有多个真正有流动性的交易所也很重要，包括 Binance。希望其他机构能够继续生存和发展，但我很担心这可能会形成一定的交易所市场中心化，我不认为这对每个人来说都是一种健康发展的态势。\n深潮 TechFlow：那你怎么看待中心化交易所（CEX）和去中心化交易所（DEX）的未来？\nSBF：有些事情只能在中心化交易所完成。为了说明这一点，我们可以思考，任何真正的计算密集型的东西，都很难在 DEX 上做，因为有吞吐量和延迟的限制。即使在今天最快的去中心化网络，数以万计的交易和数亿秒的延迟，这些数字都比你能在中心化服务器上得到的差得多。因此，当你有大量的交易或者高频交易时，在中心化交易所会有优势。\n但另一方面，一个去中心化的交易所是可验证的，它有储备金证明，它到底要做什么，代码都是在链上布置。任何人都可以在它的基础上建设，并可以用它组成其他东西，这是非常强大的。因此，去中心化的交易所也有很多优势。\n我的猜测是，我们将看到一个组合，即在一些中心化的交易所中看到一些非中心化的交易所的身影，真正计算密集型的产品将倾向于在中心化的交易所中交易，而在非中心化交易所中较少。你可以在中心化交易所更快地交易，有更多的计算资源可以使用，很明显，这是有代价的。\n深潮 TechFlow：你怎么看待在事件过程中 CZ 的角色，他的行为对整个事件产生了怎样的影响？\nSBF：他在其中发挥了很大的作用。我认为，在那之前的几个月里，他有很多公关活动，准备破坏 FTX 的市场信任。最终，他引发了破产。不仅是最初他说要卖 FTT，那个周末有一大批人跟进推文，他试图尽可能带起市场情绪，而不是仅仅试图寻找一个 OTC 交易。如果卖出 FTT 是他的首要目标，他选择了一个非常漫长的过程，要花很长时间，这会使他能够一直谈论这个话题。我认为这可能是故意的。他可能是故意想让 FTX 在这个过程中失去的更多。快要崩盘的时候，他说他想要收购。我不认为他准备认真地贯彻这个 想法，也不认为他曾认真想过会收购 FTX。他只是想跟我们打一次交道，最后肯定是会反悔的。我对 CZ 在事件中扮演的角色并不满意，这是一个有针对性的行为，这不是在试图帮助这个行业变得更好，它只是想要伤害竞争对手。\n深潮 TechFlow：你认为是他触发了本次危机？\nSBF：是的，他是最终采取了导致爆炸的行动的人。当然我也有责任，FTX没有做好风险管理，这是我的错，所以他才能有可乘之机。但我确实认为是他扣动了扳机。\n深潮 TechFlow：假设没有 Coindesk 的报道和CZ抛售 FTT，你认为 FTX 会是一种怎样的结局？\nSBF：这是一个非常好的问题。我不知道会发生什么，但我认为，我们会有更多的转机。在事件早期，不同的力量从各方涌入，从而导致了崩塌。在过去的几个月里，我已经开始重新参与到业务中，认为 FTX 将变得更加强大，我们的资产负债表将变得更加强大。\n深潮 TechFlow：为什么开始重新参与业务？有什么节点吗?\nSBF：没有什么特别的。只是前一年，我在一些事情上浪费很多时间，我一直把更多的时间放在媒体上，放在我喜欢的关于 FTX 未来愿景的品牌建设上。它们确实很重要，并不是说它们与业务无关，但我还有很多更重要的事情。\n首先，我本应该专注于风险管理，专注于检修我们的匹配引擎和其他事情。而除了我搞砸了之外，没有任何解释的空间。在过去的几个月里，我基本上接受了这个事实，即我已经变得不那么踏实，我需要更多地参与业务建设，更努力地工作，并更多地关注工作的一些重要的事情，比如修补匹配引擎和其他事情。那个时候我有很多事情要做，我已经想好了怎么进行风险管理，不幸的是，崩溃比结果更早到来。\n深潮 TechFlow：Skybridge 创始人  Anthony Scaramucci 说，在前往中东募资的旅途中，你在中东投资者面前猛烈抨击了 CZ，后来这些话传到了 CZ 耳朵里，这是真的么？如果是，你现在是否感到后悔？\nSBF：我不知道。Scaramucci 肯定是听到了什么，我不知道他的想法或感受。在筹款电话中，每个人都会谈论自己的产品。我说了很多交易所的优势，谈论我们做得好的地方，以及如何从竞争中脱颖而出。募资过程中问的最多的是，什么使你与竞争对手不同？\n这就是我所说的，有时候我只是笼统地谈论了什么使我们与众不同，有时我也会具体谈论与其他特定交易所相比，我们的优势。我试图真诚地讲述我心目中他们的好与不好，而且显然 Binance 有些地方做得非常好，这导致他们成为世界上最大的交易所，这是令人难以置信的。但我也会谈一谈我觉得我们比竞争对手更好的方式，我觉得 FTX 是有很地方优于 Binance 的。对每个人来说，可能都是如此，当他们听到好话和坏话时，引起他们共鸣的，往往是负面的那部分。\n深潮 TechFlow：FTX 拿到了很多明星 VC 的投资，比如红杉资本、Paradigm 和淡马锡，你认为在当时你吸引到众多机构投资的原因是什么？有什么窍门？\nSBF：当时我们正在寻找企业合作伙伴，他们也正在建立一个白标合作伙伴的集合。他们帮我们投资来达到这个目的，建立关系，同时获得收购的资本。我不知道他们为什么投资于 FTX 和我，他们比我更清楚。但我确实认为，我们在许多方面，都可以说是非常引人注目的产品和公司，但显然我们也有很大的优化空间。\n深潮 TechFlow：从2019年开始，你一直捐赠支持民主党，成为了民主党的最大捐赠者之一，你的动机是什么？这些钱是来自于用户吗？FTX 从“亲自政治”中获得了哪些好处？\nSBF：这些捐款不是在 FTX 上进行的，那是我给肯尼迪的捐款。这对所有那些我认为重要的、我认为候选人可以帮助支持的疫情预防和其他事业都有好处。我确实花了很多时间在华盛顿特区与监管机构和政策制定者交谈，但是为了帮助建立加密货币生态系统的监管框架，然后与监管机构讨论 FTX 的许可证。主要的捐款目的还是为了防止疫情大爆发。\n未来何去何从\n深潮 TechFlow：目前，众多势力在争夺 FTX 资产的处置权，你预计，在 FTX 无法提款的用户什么时候能拿回部分属于他们的资产？\nSBF：这很混乱。很多政府已经介入了。有巴哈马、Chapter 11 Team、欧洲的监管机构、澳大利亚的监管机构、日本的监管机构……这其实非常混乱的。我希望无论最后处置权交给谁，他们会把客户放在第一位，他们会尽一切可能为客户提供更多的帮助。他们中的一些人正在这样做，很多国际监管机构和管理者一直在帮助客户，但不幸的是，看起来确实会有一场管辖权之争。\n深潮 TechFlow：据我们了解，有很多 FTX 的员工因为信任你，大部分资产也在 FTX 上，并且没有取出来，对于这部分员工，你会给予补偿么，你想对他们说什么？\nSBF：我感到非常抱歉。我愿意做任何我想做的事情为他们做出补偿，我现在没有能力这样做。我没有资金可以给他们，但我没有忘记这一点。我希望我能够对得起他们。我希望有一天，我能够使其他每一个 FTX 的客户都得到补偿。我正在为此而努力。我不能保证我一定会成，但这是我现在花费所有时间的地方。\n坦率地说，我认为它已经在发生，我对它没有开始发生感到惊讶、沮丧和愤怒。我本以为美国和日本的所有客户如今都可以得到补偿，这本应该已经发生了。我感到困惑和惊讶的是，为什么 chapter 11 team 还没有做这一点。而且，我有几十亿美元的潜在融资提议，但都没有被采纳。这两件事都很令人沮丧。我认为，如果 chapter 11 的团队想的话，他们已经可以开始将一些资产归还给客户，但这还没有发生。我将尽我所能，使客户尽可能得到补偿。在下个月或下两个月内，这方面会有进展。\n深潮 TechFlow：你收到过刑事指控吗？你是否担心入狱？\nSBF：还没有，我不知道会发生什么。显然，监管机构正在研究这个问题。不过这不是我现在所关注的，我目前专注于客户的处理问题。在某地某时，或许我需要考虑自己，但肯定不是现在。\n*注：本文采访于 SBF 被美国司法部门起诉，巴哈马警方逮捕前。\n深潮 TechFlow：对行业造成如此重大的影响，你会有负罪感么，最让你后悔的一件事是什么？\nSBF：我对所发生的事情感到难以置信的内疚和难以置信的糟糕。我并不希望发生这些事情，但如果我有更多的行动，我本可以阻止它，我应该有更多的发言权，但我没有，我真的很后悔，出事后的那段时间我不应该在媒体消失，我本可以做更多的。\n\n\nThanks for reading 深潮 TechFlow !

A lot has been said about them in public, so we will only focus on some other, slightly more technical aspects here.</p><p>Foremost, the launch day was a memorable one. First, some (unexpected, unlike Kusama) chaos was brought upon the community when <a href=\"https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/78\">the initial proposal</a> which was supposed to enable pools passed and no new pools could yet be created. The issue was quickly discovered, and luckily, thanks to both the council and technical committee being available, within half a day, a <a href=\"https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/286\">fix motion</a> was proposed, fast-tracked by the technical committee, unanimously voted aye by the community, and executed. With that, at block <a href=\"https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/12726652\">12726652</a>, the first nomination pools on Polkadot were created.</p><p>Then, an interesting competition to obtain pool id 1 was unraveled. Within the first block, 8 pools was already created, indicating that interested participants used bots and transaction tips to compete with one another.</p><p>Within the next few days, all the 64 pools that were initially designated to exist were created. As noted in the proposal description, the 64 limit is merely a temporary measure of rate control, and there is no technical reason for it to exist. Nonetheless, history has shown us that it is for the benefit of the protocol to start slow, especially with a new feature.</p><blockquote>You can learn more about the aftermath of launching pools <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P0VqiL7T_P4?t=255\">in the 9th episode of the AGG podcast</a>.</blockquote><h3 id=\"nomination-pools-whats-next\">Nomination Pools: What&apos;s Next?</h3><p>With the initial launch behind us, we should discuss the immediate next steps that could follow:</p><p><strong>Commission</strong>: Our initial assumption when designing nomination pools was to exclude commission, namely because:</p><ol><li>Running a pool has not hardware cost, unlike a validator.</li><li>Entities would have other, non-financial incentives to operate a pool.</li></ol><p>Nonetheless, from a framework perspective, we decided to add an optional commission to the <code>pallet-nomination-pools</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12511\">Substrate</a> (the underlying SDK for building Polkadot and parachains) for the sake of completeness. We will make sure that this feature remains optional, and the final decision of enabling it is left out to the Polkadot community.</p><p>Moreover, we still predict that even if setting a commission is allowed, nomination pools&apos; market will adjust around an extremely small commission, as most pool operators would run their pool with a small amount of commission.</p><p><strong>Governance</strong>: Currently, DOT (and KSM) staked in the nomination pools are not directly usable in the governance.

A lot has been said about them in public, so we will only focus on some other, slightly more technical aspects here.\nForemost, the launch day was a memorable one. First, some (unexpected, unlike Kusama) chaos was brought upon the community when the initial proposal which was supposed to enable pools passed and no new pools could yet be created. The issue was quickly discovered, and luckily, thanks to both the council and technical committee being available, within half a day, a fix motion was proposed, fast-tracked by the technical committee, unanimously voted aye by the community, and executed. With that, at block 12726652, the first nomination pools on Polkadot were created.\nThen, an interesting competition to obtain pool id 1 was unraveled. Within the first block, 8 pools was already created, indicating that interested participants used bots and transaction tips to compete with one another.\nWithin the next few days, all the 64 pools that were initially designated to exist were created. As noted in the proposal description, the 64 limit is merely a temporary measure of rate control, and there is no technical reason for it to exist. Nonetheless, history has shown us that it is for the benefit of the protocol to start slow, especially with a new feature.\nYou can learn more about the aftermath of launching pools in the 9th episode of the AGG podcast.\nNomination Pools: What's Next?\nWith the initial launch behind us, we should discuss the immediate next steps that could follow:\nCommission: Our initial assumption when designing nomination pools was to exclude commission, namely because:\n\nRunning a pool has not hardware cost, unlike a validator.\nEntities would have other, non-financial incentives to operate a pool.\n\nNonetheless, from a framework perspective, we decided to add an optional commission to the pallet-nomination-pools in Substrate (the underlying SDK for building Polkadot and parachains) for the sake of completeness. We will make sure that this feature remains optional, and the final decision of enabling it is left out to the Polkadot community.\nMoreover, we still predict that even if setting a commission is allowed, nomination pools' market will adjust around an extremely small commission, as most pool operators would run their pool with a small amount of commission.\nGovernance: Currently, DOT (and KSM) staked in the nomination pools are not directly usable in the governance. This is the next high priority item in our list, and we are currently exploring multiple ways to enable it.\nStaking In Governance\nOther than the proposals related to enablement of nomination pools, two other staking-related governance items are ongoing.\nFirst, a discussion/proposal is ongoing to double the number of nomination pools from 64 to 128. This is expected, and we highly support it. Pools are highly scalable and the community should gradually move toward using it to its utmost extent.\nNext, a proposal has been opened to tweak the existing limits on nominators. The proposal description is fairly extensive, but to summarize: The proposal argues that with the existence of nomination pools, and the fact that the threshold to be an active nominator is around 200 DOT, Polkadot should no longer accept nominator with 10 DOT (existing limit). The proposal suggest increasing this limit to 100 DOT. Also, the proposal is removing any limits on the total number of nominator, as this number has also been just a precautionary limit and is no longer needed.\nStaking Roadmap\nWith the release of nomination pools, it could be argued that Polkadot's staking is (after almost a year of intense development) at a \"stable\" position. Namely, it has reached a point of having a high degree of scalability, without compromising on the core benefits of NPoS. We are exploring future directions that can be taken as next step, and will share them with the community through the Polkadot forum within the next few months.
