Data Pipeline is a customized data source, or “connector,” built on <a href=\"https://airbyte.com/\">Airbyte</a>, which provides an ELT approach allowing users to select which KYVE data set to extract, load it onto their preferred backend, then transform it in whatever or however many ways they need for their use case.

For those wanting to code their own solution for sourcing KYVE data, they can do so via the REST-API.</p><h3>Data Access Via REST-API</h3><p>The REST-API is a resource model outlining the major details you need to know about a given piece of data. For example, where and how it’s being stored. For KYVE, its data is available through the REST-API exposed by its chain nodes. This integration is a native way to access data in a completely trustless way via coding your own solution to get KYVE data (currently on testnet) onto your own application and or database. To get started, a list of REST endpoints can be found<a href=\"https://docs.kyve.network/developers/grpc.html#api-endpoint\"> here</a>.</p><p>Since KYVE stores data onto specialized providers and not natively on its own chain, developers must fetch the underlying data directly from the storage provider. The KYVE REST-API holds the proof that data on a storage provider is valid and can be retrieved trustless. A list of valid bundles is available at the kyve/query/v1beta1/finalized_bundles/[pool_id] path.</p><p>From this, the developer will get the storage_provider_id which points to a storage provider. In combination with the storage_id, developers can retrieve the uploaded data.</p><p>Some integrations might compress data before storing it on the storage provider. The compression_id indicates which compression method has been used.</p><p>Below displays the general workflow of this process:</p><pre>response = <br>requests.get(f”https://api.korellia.kyve.network/kyve/query/v1beta1/finalized_bundles/{pool_id_input}&quot;)<br>for bundle in response.json().get(“finalized_bundles”):<br>   storage_id = bundle.get(“storage_id”)<br><br>   # retrieve file from Arweave<br>   response_from_arweave = <br>requests.get(f”https://arweave.net/{storage_id}&quot;)<br>   decompressed = gzip.decompress(response_from_arweave.content)<br>   decompressed_as_json = json.loads(decompressed)</pre><p>After the data has been retrieved from the storage provider and decompressed, developers can use it in their applications.</p><h3>More Solutions to Come</h3><p>KYVE’s goal is to help build a secure, scalable, and trustless data infrastructure for all; therefore, our team is always looking for new ways to ease the data use and access experience. With new data risks and KYVE use cases popping up each day, KYVE is just getting started introducing new solutions to best benefit from its decentralized data lake.

His SECRET is, when asked pointed questions, he switches to market-plumbing speak, hiding behind lingo.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Let me help you understand SBF's moves.</p>\n  <p>:thread: :point_down:</p>\n  <p>\\</p>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Anytime you hear or read \"Alameda,\" replace with, \"Sam's personal account.\"</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  When Alameda borrows FTX customer money, that means \"Sam borrows customer money\": Alameda is 100% owned by Sam &amp; a few friends. Alameda had no clients. \"Alameda's capital\" is Sam's, Caroline's, etc.</p>\n  <p>:point_down:</p>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>Sam says he poorly \"risk-managed\" the FTX and Alameda relationship.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  Recall: Alameda=Sam. What transpired?</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Had Liquidity Issues</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • The Collateral Was Pretend Money</p>\n  <p>\\\n  3) Alameda (Sam) Had Issues:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Nobody has nailed down what happened: was Alameda *always* a fraud or did it suffer losses at some point and then get desperate (perhaps the Terra Luna implosion in the spring)?</p>\n  <p>\\\n  This is a question begging for an answer. I don't know, but…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true\">https://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4)…Sam claims he was no longer closely involved in Alameda (again, Alameda = Sam's personal capital). Sam claims Caroline &amp; Team ran it independently (other than its venture investments).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  This claim gives Sam cover to state he doesn't know the details about Alameda's issues.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  5) Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  At some point - time uncertain - Alameda (Sam) needed access to liquidity. It almost certainly had margin loans from 3rd parties being called (3rd parties like Gemini or Binance…maybe FTX?). To repay these, Alameda needed liquidity.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  6) To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  FTX client assets were the liquidity that Alameda (Sam) needed to repay its other loans. To pretend this was OK, FTX needed to hold collateral from Alameda as security against the loan (in case Alameda (Sam) didn't repay).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  7) When you borrow cash on margin, you generally have to post MORE collateral than you borrow.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Ex: you might borrow against your Schwab account. Schwab holds your account's assets as protection against you defaulting on the loan. This lets you turn investments into liquidity.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  8) Elon's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> margin loan is a prominent example:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of TSLA stock he posts (giving him cash to do anything, like buy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TWTR&src=cashtag_click\">$TWTR</a>, without selling TSLA).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  After borrowing from the facility, if TSLA stock falls below a certain threshold (say $1 to $3)…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  9)…Elon needs to either add more collateral to the margin facility (post more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a>) or pay down the loan.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  If he does neither, the lender can liquidate the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> it holds as collateral and repay the loan from the proceeds.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Now back to Alameda (Sam)…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  10) Together, FTX &amp; Alameda (Sam &amp; Sam) developed a few shitcoins…err \"tokens\": the most relevant are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a>.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Both FTX &amp; Alameda received huge grants of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a> (I'm just going to use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> going forward).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  F&amp;A (Sam) controlled the VAST majority of the issuance…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  11)…and only a tiny portion of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a> traded. Alameda was the largest trader. If you own 95% of something and then manipulate the price of the other 5%, you can make your 95% look REALLY valuable - just keep the price of that 5% up and look how valuable your 95% becomes!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://tenor.com/va2h.gif?embedable=true\">https://tenor.com/va2h.gif?embedable=true</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"12\">\n  <li>Guess what Alameda (Sam) used as collateral for those margin loans we were talking about? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a>.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  And it doesn't appear that FTX required a big haircut on those. Remember that Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> stock he posts? That's an 80% haircut. But…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  13)…it doesn't appear FTX required a substantial haircut on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> that Alameda (Sam) posted. Ultimately, using these shitcoins…I mean tokens, as collateral, Alameda (Sam) \"borrowed\" $9-$10 billion from FTX. That money was, almost by definition, FTX customer money.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  14) You might recall that Sam famously described tokens like these to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart\">@TheStalwart</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tracyalloway\">@tracyalloway</a> as \"magic money in a box.\" It was recognized immediately as Sam describing a Ponzi.

His SECRET is, when asked pointed questions, he switches to market-plumbing speak, hiding behind lingo.\n\\\n  Let me help you understand SBF's moves.\n:thread: :point_down:\n\\\n  \nAnytime you hear or read \"Alameda,\" replace with, \"Sam's personal account.\"\n\\\n  When Alameda borrows FTX customer money, that means \"Sam borrows customer money\": Alameda is 100% owned by Sam & a few friends. Alameda had no clients. \"Alameda's capital\" is Sam's, Caroline's, etc.\n:point_down:\nSam says he poorly \"risk-managed\" the FTX and Alameda relationship.\n\\\n  Recall: Alameda=Sam. What transpired?\n\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Had Liquidity Issues\n\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX\n\\\n  • To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX\n\\\n  • The Collateral Was Pretend Money\n\\\n  3) Alameda (Sam) Had Issues:\n\\\n  Nobody has nailed down what happened: was Alameda *always* a fraud or did it suffer losses at some point and then get desperate (perhaps the Terra Luna implosion in the spring)?\n\\\n  This is a question begging for an answer. I don't know, but…\nhttps://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true\n4)…Sam claims he was no longer closely involved in Alameda (again, Alameda = Sam's personal capital). Sam claims Caroline & Team ran it independently (other than its venture investments).\n\\\n  This claim gives Sam cover to state he doesn't know the details about Alameda's issues.\n\\\n  5) Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX:\n\\\n  At some point - time uncertain - Alameda (Sam) needed access to liquidity. It almost certainly had margin loans from 3rd parties being called (3rd parties like Gemini or Binance…maybe FTX?). To repay these, Alameda needed liquidity.\n\\\n  6) To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX:\n\\\n  FTX client assets were the liquidity that Alameda (Sam) needed to repay its other loans. To pretend this was OK, FTX needed to hold collateral from Alameda as security against the loan (in case Alameda (Sam) didn't repay).\n\\\n  7) When you borrow cash on margin, you generally have to post MORE collateral than you borrow.\n\\\n  Ex: you might borrow against your Schwab account. Schwab holds your account's assets as protection against you defaulting on the loan. This lets you turn investments into liquidity.\n\\\n  8) Elon's $TSLA margin loan is a prominent example:\n\\\n  Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of TSLA stock he posts (giving him cash to do anything, like buy $TWTR, without selling TSLA).\n\\\n  After borrowing from the facility, if TSLA stock falls below a certain threshold (say $1 to $3)…\n\\\n  9)…Elon needs to either add more collateral to the margin facility (post more $TSLA) or pay down the loan.\n\\\n  If he does neither, the lender can liquidate the $TSLA it holds as collateral and repay the loan from the proceeds.\n\\\n  Now back to Alameda (Sam)…\n\\\n  10) Together, FTX & Alameda (Sam & Sam) developed a few shitcoins…err \"tokens\": the most relevant are $FTT and $SRM.\n\\\n  Both FTX & Alameda received huge grants of $FTT and $SRM (I'm just going to use $FTT going forward).\n\\\n  F&A (Sam) controlled the VAST majority of the issuance…\n\\\n  11)…and only a tiny portion of $FTT / $SRM traded. Alameda was the largest trader. If you own 95% of something and then manipulate the price of the other 5%, you can make your 95% look REALLY valuable - just keep the price of that 5% up and look how valuable your 95% becomes!\nhttps://tenor.com/va2h.gif?embedable=true\nGuess what Alameda (Sam) used as collateral for those margin loans we were talking about? $FTT and $SRM.\n\\\n  And it doesn't appear that FTX required a big haircut on those. Remember that Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of $TSLA stock he posts? That's an 80% haircut. But…\n\\\n  13)…it doesn't appear FTX required a substantial haircut on the $FTT that Alameda (Sam) posted. Ultimately, using these shitcoins…I mean tokens, as collateral, Alameda (Sam) \"borrowed\" $9-$10 billion from FTX. That money was, almost by definition, FTX customer money.\n\\\n  14) You might recall that Sam famously described tokens like these to @TheStalwart and @tracyalloway as \"magic money in a box.\" It was recognized immediately as Sam describing a Ponzi. But most of us didn't realize *Sam* was issuing these magic tokens.\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=KZYqL79GDXU&t=1292s\n\\\n\n  \nSam may argue this is just how banks (and brokerages) work: they take deposits, they lend them out based on credit judgments to earn a spread, and - as long as depositors don't ask for deposits back en masse - all is perfectly fine.\n\\\n  But let me tell you what banks don't do:\n\\\n  16) Banks do not:\n\\\n  • Lend 70% of their deposits to one borrower\n\\\n  • Have that borrower be the founder of the bank\n\\\n  • Accept made-up \"tokens\" as collateral - the actual worst collateral ever conceived • Have almost all that collateral be just two (made up) assets\n\\\n  17)\n\\\n  • Apply de minimis haircuts to collateral\n\\\n  • Accept derivatives of the bank itself as collateral! $FTT is not random - it relates to FTX\n\\\n  As @matt_levine said, Goldman Sachs should not take $GS equity as collateral - it is circular risk. And definitely not pretend-GS equity.\n\\\n  18) This Collateral Was Pretend Money\n\\\n  Alameda (Sam) & FTX (also Sam) invented intrinsically worthless tokens, keeping almost all of it for themselves.

I am not an attorney, but these issues need to be addressed–at least within the culture that surrounds the use of these models, if not the legal system itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copyright protects outputs of creative processes, not inputs. You can copyright a work you produced, whether that’s a computer program, a literary work, music, or an image. There is a concept of “fair use” that’s most applicable to text, but still applicable in other domains. The problem with fair use is that it is never precisely defined. The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20fair%20use%20doctrine,news%20reporting%2C%20and%20scholarly%20reports.\" target=\"_blank\">US Copyright Office’s statement about fair use</a> is a model for vagueness:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Under the fair use doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is permissible to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and scholarly reports. There are no legal rules permitting the use of a specific number of words, a certain number of musical notes, or percentage of a work. Whether a particular use qualifies as fair use depends on all the circumstances.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We are left with a web of conventions and traditions. You can’t quote another work in its entirety without permission. For a long time, it was considered acceptable to quote up to 400 words without permission, though that number was never codified into law, and has been going down recently–and counting words applies poorly to software as well as works that aren’t written text. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20fair%20use%20doctrine,news%20reporting%2C%20and%20scholarly%20reports.\" target=\"_blank\">Elsewhere</a> the US copyright office states that fair use includes ”transformative” use, though “transformative” has never been defined precisely. It also states that copyright does not extend to ideas or facts, only to particular expressions of those facts–but we have to ask where the “idea” ends and where the “expression” begins. Interpretation of these principles will have to come from the courts, and the body of US case law on software copyright is surprisingly small–only 13 cases, according to the copyright office’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html\" target=\"_blank\">search engine</a>. Although the body of case law for music and other art forms is larger, it’s even less clear how these ideas apply. Just as quoting a poem in its entirety is a copyright violation, you can’t reproduce images in their entirety without permission. But how much of a song or a painting can you reproduce? Counting words isn’t just ill-defined, it is useless for works that aren’t made of words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These rules of thumb are clearly about outputs, rather than inputs: again, the ideas that go into an article aren’t protected, just the words. That’s where generative models present problems. Under some circumstances, output from Copilot may contain, verbatim, lines from copyrighted code. The legal system has tools to handle this case, even if those tools are imprecise. Microsoft is currently being <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/software/369456/github-copilot-sued-over-software-piracy-on-unprecendented-scale\" target=\"_blank\">sued for “software piracy”</a> because of GitHub. The case is based on outputs: code generated by Copilot that reproduces code in its training set, but that doesn’t carry license notices or attribution. It’s about Copilot’s compliance with the license attached to the original software. However, that lawsuit doesn’t address the more important question. Copilot itself is a commercial product that is built a body of training data, even though it is completely different from that data. It’s clearly “transformative.” In any AI application, the training data is at least as important to the final product as the algorithms, if not more important. Should the rights of the authors of the training data be taken into account when a model is built from their work, even if the model never reproduces their work verbatim? Copyright does not adequately address the inputs to the algorithm at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can ask similar questions about works of art. Andy Baio has a great <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://waxy.org/2022/11/invasive-diffusion-how-one-unwilling-illustrator-found-herself-turned-into-an-ai-model/\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> of an artist, Hollie Mengert, whose work was used to train a specialized version of Stable Diffusion. This model enables anyone to produce Mengert-like artworks from a textual prompt. They’re not actual reproductions; and they’re not as good as her genuine artworks–but arguably “good enough” for most purposes. (If you ask Stable Diffusion to generate “Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci,” you get something that clearly looks like Mona Lisa, but that would embarrass poor Leonardo.) However, users of a model can produce dozens, or hundreds, of works in the time Mengert takes to make one. We certainly have to ask what it does to the value of Mengert’s art. Does copyright law protect “in the style of”? I don’t think anyone knows. Legal arguments over whether works generated by the model are “transformative” would be expensive, possibly endless, and likely pointless. (One hallmark of law in the US is that cases are almost always decided by people who aren’t experts. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" target=\"_blank\">The Grotesque Legacy of Music as Property</a> shows how this applies to music.) And copyright law doesn’t protect the inputs to a creative process, whether that creative process is human or cybernetic. Should it? As humans, we are always learning from the work of others; “standing on the shoulders of giants” is a quote with a history that goes well before Isaac Newton used it. Are machines also allowed to stand on the shoulders of giants?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-973x1048.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14807\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-973x1048.png 973w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-279x300.png 279w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-768x827.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01.png 977w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px\" /><figcaption><br>Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci. DaVinci isn’t worried. (Courtesy Hugo Bowne-Anderson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To think about this, we need an understanding of what copyright does culturally. It’s a double-edged sword. I’ve written several times about how <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/01/on-pirates-and-piracy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Beethoven and Bach made use of popular tunes in their music</a>, in ways that certainly wouldn’t be legal under current copyright law. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" target=\"_blank\">Jazz</a> is full of artists quoting, copying, and expanding on each other. So is classical music–we’ve just learned to ignore that part of the tradition. Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart could easily have been sued for their appropriation of popular music (for that matter, they could have sued each other, and been sued by many of their “legitimate” contemporaries)–but that process of appropriating and moving beyond is a crucial part of how art works. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14811\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02.png 868w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02-300x261.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02-768x667.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" /><figcaption><br>J. S. Bach’s 371Choral Copyright Violations. He would have been in trouble if copyright as we now understand it had existed.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have to recognize the protection that copyright gives to artists. We lost most of Elizabethan theater because there was no copyright.&nbsp;Plays were the property of the theater companies (and playwrights were often members of those companies), but that property wasn’t protected; there was nothing to prevent another company from performing your play.&nbsp; Consequently, playwrights had no interest in publishing their plays. The scripts were, literally, trade secrets. We’ve probably lost at least one play by Shakespeare (there’s evidence he wrote a play called Love’s Labors Won); we’ve lost all but one of the plays of Thomas Kyd; and there are other playwrights known through playbills, reviews, and other references for whom there are no surviving works. Christopher Marlowe’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Faustus_(play)\" target=\"_blank\">Doctor Faustus</a>, the most important pre-Shakespearian play, is known to us through two editions, both published after Marlowe’s death, and one of those editions is roughly a third longer than the other. What did Marlowe actually write? We’ll never know. Without some kind of protection, authors had no interest in publishing at all, let alone publishing accurate texts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there’s a finely tuned balance to copyright, which we almost certainly haven’t achieved in practice. It needs to protect creativity without destroying the ability to learn from and modify earlier works. Free and open source software couldn’t exist without the protection of copyright–though without that protection, open source might not be needed. Patents were intended to play a similar role: to encourage the spread of information by guaranteeing that inventors could profit from their invention, limiting the need for “trade secrets.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copying works of art has always been (and still is) a part of an artist’s education. Authors write and rewrite each other’s works constantly; whole careers have been made tracing the interactions between John Milton and William Blake. Whether we’re talking about prose or painting, generative AI devalues traditional artistic technique (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/on-technique/\" target=\"_blank\">as I’ve argued</a>), though possibly giving rise to a different kind of technique: the technique of writing prompts that tell the machine what to create. That’s a task that is neither simple nor uncreative. To take Mona Lisa and go a step further than Da Vinci–or to go beyond facile imitations of Hollie Mengert–requires an understanding of what this new medium can do, and how to control it. Part of Google’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://bdtechtalks.com/2022/11/07/google-generative-ai-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">AI strategy</a> appears to be building tools that help artists to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://wordcraft-writers-workshop.appspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">collaborate</a> with AI systems; their goal is&nbsp; to enable authors to create works that are transformative, that do more than simply reproducing a style or piecing together sentences. This kind of work certainly raises questions of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/people/mike-loukides/\" target=\"_blank\">reproducibility</a>: given the output of an AI system, can that output be recreated or modified in predictable ways? And it might cause us to realize that the old cliche “A picture is worth a thousand words” significantly underestimates the number of words it takes to describe a picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we best protect creative freedom?&nbsp;Is a work of art something that can be “owned,” and what does that mean in an age when digital works can be reproduced perfectly, at will? We need to protect both the original artists, like Hollie Mengert, and those who use their original work as a springboard to go beyond. Our current copyright system does that poorly, if at all. (And the existence of patent trolls demonstrates that patent law hasn’t done much better.)&nbsp; What was originally intended to protect artists has turned into a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" target=\"_blank\">rent-seeking game in which artists who can afford lawyers monetize the creativity of artists who can’t</a>. Copyright needs to protect the input side of any generative system: it needs to govern the use of intellectual property as training data for machines. But copyright also needs to protect the people who are being genuinely creative with those machines: not just making more works “in the style of,” but treating AI as a new artistic medium. The finely tuned balance that copyright needs to maintain has just become more difficult. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be solutions outside of the copyright system. Shutterstock, which previously announced that they were removing all AI-generated images from their catalog, has announced a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2343953-shutterstock-will-sell-ai-generated-art-and-compensate-human-artists/\" target=\"_blank\">collaboration with OpenAI</a> that allow the creation of images using a model that has only been trained on images licensed to Shutterstock. Creators of the images used for training will receive a royalty based on images created by the model. Shutterstock hasn’t released any details about the compensation plan, and it’s easy to suspect that the actual payments will be similar to the royalties musicians get from streaming services: microcents per use. But their approach could work with the right compensation plan. Deviant Art has released <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.dreamup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DreamUp</a>, a model based on Stable Diffusion that allows artists to specify whether models can be trained on their content, along with identifying all of its outputs as computer generated. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/adobe-stock-begins-selling-ai-generated-artwork/\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> has just announced their own set of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/stock/contributor/help/generative-ai-content.html\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a> for submitting generative art to their Adobe Stock collection, which requiring that AI-generated art be labeled as such, and that the (human) creators have obtained all the licenses that might be required for the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These solutions could be taken a step further. What if the models were trained on licenses, in addition to the original works themselves? It is easy to imagine an AI system that has been trained on the (many) Open Source and Creative Commons licenses. A user could specify what license terms were acceptable, and the system would generate appropriate output–including licenses and attributions, and taking care of compensation where necessary.

I am not an attorney, but these issues need to be addressed–at least within the culture that surrounds the use of these models, if not the legal system itself.\nCopyright protects outputs of creative processes, not inputs. You can copyright a work you produced, whether that’s a computer program, a literary work, music, or an image. There is a concept of “fair use” that’s most applicable to text, but still applicable in other domains. The problem with fair use is that it is never precisely defined. The US Copyright Office’s statement about fair use is a model for vagueness:\nUnder the fair use doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is permissible to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and scholarly reports. There are no legal rules permitting the use of a specific number of words, a certain number of musical notes, or percentage of a work. Whether a particular use qualifies as fair use depends on all the circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nWe are left with a web of conventions and traditions. You can’t quote another work in its entirety without permission. For a long time, it was considered acceptable to quote up to 400 words without permission, though that number was never codified into law, and has been going down recently–and counting words applies poorly to software as well as works that aren’t written text. Elsewhere the US copyright office states that fair use includes ”transformative” use, though “transformative” has never been defined precisely. It also states that copyright does not extend to ideas or facts, only to particular expressions of those facts–but we have to ask where the “idea” ends and where the “expression” begins. Interpretation of these principles will have to come from the courts, and the body of US case law on software copyright is surprisingly small–only 13 cases, according to the copyright office’s search engine. Although the body of case law for music and other art forms is larger, it’s even less clear how these ideas apply. Just as quoting a poem in its entirety is a copyright violation, you can’t reproduce images in their entirety without permission. But how much of a song or a painting can you reproduce? Counting words isn’t just ill-defined, it is useless for works that aren’t made of words.\nThese rules of thumb are clearly about outputs, rather than inputs: again, the ideas that go into an article aren’t protected, just the words. That’s where generative models present problems. Under some circumstances, output from Copilot may contain, verbatim, lines from copyrighted code. The legal system has tools to handle this case, even if those tools are imprecise. Microsoft is currently being sued for “software piracy” because of GitHub. The case is based on outputs: code generated by Copilot that reproduces code in its training set, but that doesn’t carry license notices or attribution. It’s about Copilot’s compliance with the license attached to the original software. However, that lawsuit doesn’t address the more important question. Copilot itself is a commercial product that is built a body of training data, even though it is completely different from that data. It’s clearly “transformative.” In any AI application, the training data is at least as important to the final product as the algorithms, if not more important. Should the rights of the authors of the training data be taken into account when a model is built from their work, even if the model never reproduces their work verbatim? Copyright does not adequately address the inputs to the algorithm at all.\nWe can ask similar questions about works of art. Andy Baio has a great discussion of an artist, Hollie Mengert, whose work was used to train a specialized version of Stable Diffusion. This model enables anyone to produce Mengert-like artworks from a textual prompt. They’re not actual reproductions; and they’re not as good as her genuine artworks–but arguably “good enough” for most purposes. (If you ask Stable Diffusion to generate “Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci,” you get something that clearly looks like Mona Lisa, but that would embarrass poor Leonardo.) However, users of a model can produce dozens, or hundreds, of works in the time Mengert takes to make one. We certainly have to ask what it does to the value of Mengert’s art. Does copyright law protect “in the style of”? I don’t think anyone knows. Legal arguments over whether works generated by the model are “transformative” would be expensive, possibly endless, and likely pointless. (One hallmark of law in the US is that cases are almost always decided by people who aren’t experts. The Grotesque Legacy of Music as Property shows how this applies to music.) And copyright law doesn’t protect the inputs to a creative process, whether that creative process is human or cybernetic. Should it? As humans, we are always learning from the work of others; “standing on the shoulders of giants” is a quote with a history that goes well before Isaac Newton used it. Are machines also allowed to stand on the shoulders of giants?\n\nMona Lisa in the style of DaVinci. DaVinci isn’t worried. (Courtesy Hugo Bowne-Anderson)\n\n\n\nTo think about this, we need an understanding of what copyright does culturally. It’s a double-edged sword. I’ve written several times about how Beethoven and Bach made use of popular tunes in their music, in ways that certainly wouldn’t be legal under current copyright law. Jazz is full of artists quoting, copying, and expanding on each other. So is classical music–we’ve just learned to ignore that part of the tradition. Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart could easily have been sued for their appropriation of popular music (for that matter, they could have sued each other, and been sued by many of their “legitimate” contemporaries)–but that process of appropriating and moving beyond is a crucial part of how art works. \n\nJ. S. Bach’s 371Choral Copyright Violations. He would have been in trouble if copyright as we now understand it had existed.\n\n\n\nWe also have to recognize the protection that copyright gives to artists. We lost most of Elizabethan theater because there was no copyright. Plays were the property of the theater companies (and playwrights were often members of those companies), but that property wasn’t protected; there was nothing to prevent another company from performing your play.  Consequently, playwrights had no interest in publishing their plays. The scripts were, literally, trade secrets. We’ve probably lost at least one play by Shakespeare (there’s evidence he wrote a play called Love’s Labors Won); we’ve lost all but one of the plays of Thomas Kyd; and there are other playwrights known through playbills, reviews, and other references for whom there are no surviving works. Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus, the most important pre-Shakespearian play, is known to us through two editions, both published after Marlowe’s death, and one of those editions is roughly a third longer than the other. What did Marlowe actually write? We’ll never know. Without some kind of protection, authors had no interest in publishing at all, let alone publishing accurate texts.\nSo there’s a finely tuned balance to copyright, which we almost certainly haven’t achieved in practice. It needs to protect creativity without destroying the ability to learn from and modify earlier works. Free and open source software couldn’t exist without the protection of copyright–though without that protection, open source might not be needed. Patents were intended to play a similar role: to encourage the spread of information by guaranteeing that inventors could profit from their invention, limiting the need for “trade secrets.”\nCopying works of art has always been (and still is) a part of an artist’s education. Authors write and rewrite each other’s works constantly; whole careers have been made tracing the interactions between John Milton and William Blake. Whether we’re talking about prose or painting, generative AI devalues traditional artistic technique (as I’ve argued), though possibly giving rise to a different kind of technique: the technique of writing prompts that tell the machine what to create. That’s a task that is neither simple nor uncreative. To take Mona Lisa and go a step further than Da Vinci–or to go beyond facile imitations of Hollie Mengert–requires an understanding of what this new medium can do, and how to control it. Part of Google’s AI strategy appears to be building tools that help artists to collaborate with AI systems; their goal is  to enable authors to create works that are transformative, that do more than simply reproducing a style or piecing together sentences. This kind of work certainly raises questions of reproducibility: given the output of an AI system, can that output be recreated or modified in predictable ways? And it might cause us to realize that the old cliche “A picture is worth a thousand words” significantly underestimates the number of words it takes to describe a picture.\nHow do we best protect creative freedom? Is a work of art something that can be “owned,” and what does that mean in an age when digital works can be reproduced perfectly, at will? We need to protect both the original artists, like Hollie Mengert, and those who use their original work as a springboard to go beyond. Our current copyright system does that poorly, if at all. (And the existence of patent trolls demonstrates that patent law hasn’t done much better.)  What was originally intended to protect artists has turned into a rent-seeking game in which artists who can afford lawyers monetize the creativity of artists who can’t. Copyright needs to protect the input side of any generative system: it needs to govern the use of intellectual property as training data for machines. But copyright also needs to protect the people who are being genuinely creative with those machines: not just making more works “in the style of,” but treating AI as a new artistic medium. The finely tuned balance that copyright needs to maintain has just become more difficult. \nThere may be solutions outside of the copyright system. Shutterstock, which previously announced that they were removing all AI-generated images from their catalog, has announced a collaboration with OpenAI that allow the creation of images using a model that has only been trained on images licensed to Shutterstock. Creators of the images used for training will receive a royalty based on images created by the model. Shutterstock hasn’t released any details about the compensation plan, and it’s easy to suspect that the actual payments will be similar to the royalties musicians get from streaming services: microcents per use. But their approach could work with the right compensation plan. Deviant Art has released DreamUp, a model based on Stable Diffusion that allows artists to specify whether models can be trained on their content, along with identifying all of its outputs as computer generated. Adobe has just announced their own set of guidelines for submitting generative art to their Adobe Stock collection, which requiring that AI-generated art be labeled as such, and that the (human) creators have obtained all the licenses that might be required for the work.\nThese solutions could be taken a step further. What if the models were trained on licenses, in addition to the original works themselves? It is easy to imagine an AI system that has been trained on the (many) Open Source and Creative Commons licenses. A user could specify what license terms were acceptable, and the system would generate appropriate output–including licenses and attributions, and taking care of compensation where necessary. We need to remember that few of the current generative AI tools that now exist can be used “for free.” They generate income, and that income can be used to compensate creators.\nUltimately we need both solutions: fixing copyright law to accommodate works used to train AI systems, and developing AI systems that respect the rights of the people who made the works on which their models were trained. One can’t happen without the other.","dc:creator":"Mike Loukides","comments":"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-does-copyright-say-about-generative-models/#respond","content":"The current generation of flashy AI applications, ranging from GitHub Copilot to Stable Diffusion, raise fundamental issues with copyright law.

While symbolic execution is a powerful technique that can augment the vulnerability discovery process, it requires some base domain knowledge and thus has its own learning curve. Given the plethora of ways in which a user can interact with such an engine and the need for frequent context switching between a disassembler and one’s terminal or script editor, integrating symbolic execution into one’s workflow can be daunting for a beginner.</p>\n<p>One of the ways Trail of Bits has sought to ease this process is by making graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Manticore that are embedded in popular interactive disassemblers. Last summer, former intern Alan Chang worked on the first such interface, <a href=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/11/17/mui-visualizing-symbolic-execution-with-manticore-and-binary-ninja/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Manticore User Interface (MUI) plugin for Binary Ninja</a>. We found that pairing Manticore directly with an interactive disassembler provides vulnerability researchers with a more convenient way to actually use (and benefit from) symbolic execution. Therefore, during my winter and summer internships at Trail of Bits, my goal was to help grow the MUI ecosystem by making a MUI plugin for Ghidra and building infrastructure to make these plugins easier to use, maintain, and develop.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103448\" style=\"width: 791px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103448\" data-attachment-id=\"103448\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/manitcore_chart/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=781%2C321&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"781,321\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Manitcore_chart\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=690%2C284&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-103448\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=690%2C284&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?w=781&amp;ssl=1 781w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=768%2C316&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103448\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.</p></div>\n<h2>The Ghidra Plugin</h2>\n<p>We figured that the most direct way to encourage more people to use MUI plugins would be to simply develop MUI plugins for a greater variety of disassemblers! Thus, I spent my winternship developing a Ghidra version of the MUI plugin; I chose Ghidra chiefly because it is popular and, unlike the commercial tool Binary Ninja, free and open source. Additionally, a few internal projects at Trail of Bits were already using Ghidra, so I would have ample opportunity to explore Ghidra plugin development. Finally, by developing a Ghidra plugin (one written in Java instead of Python), we could develop a solution that wouldn’t be tied to a single programming language, gaining insight that could guide the development of future plugins.</p>\n<p>This initial Ghidra plugin mimicked the existing Binary Ninja plugin as closely as possible. While it took a bit of time to become familiar with Java Swing and Ghidra’s widgets, simply mimicking the existing visual components and user interface was a fairly trivial task once I got going.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103450\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103450\" data-attachment-id=\"103450\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4-06-25-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=1240%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1240,416\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 4.06.25 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;A side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=300%2C101&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=690%2C232&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=690%2C232&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=1024%2C344&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=300%2C101&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=768%2C258&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=1200%2C403&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?w=1240&amp;ssl=1 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.</p></div>\n<p>However, because the Ghidra plugin would be written in Java, it could not depend on the Manticore Python package or directly call Manticore’s Python API. Our solution to that challenge was to use a tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/linkedin/shiv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shiv</a> to seamlessly bundle the Manticore library and all of its dependencies into a <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0441/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python zipapp</a>. That way, we could create a “batteries-included” Manticore binary and then translate the Binary Ninja plugin’s interactions with the Manticore API into the appropriate command-line arguments. We then placed this binary in the relevant platform-specific subdirectories of Ghidra’s <code>os</code> directory, which facilitates cross-platform support.</p>\n<p>By the end of the winternship, I was able to add extra features to the Ghidra plugin, such as the ability to specify arbitrary Manticore arguments in addition to those with dedicated input fields and support for multiple Manticore instances in the same Ghidra session. This, however, brought to light an additional problem.</p>\n<h2>Feature parity and cross-disassembler development</h2>\n<p>It quickly became apparent that our approach to plugin development would not be sustainable if we aspired to expand the MUI project to support even more disassemblers. For each new MUI feature, we would first have to determine how to implement the feature, accounting for the way that the plugin interacts with Manticore (e.g., through direct calls to the Manticore API or through Manticore’s command-line interface options). Furthermore, certain front-end information shared across plugins (e.g., fixed description strings or sensible default options) would have to be repeated and standardized in each implementation.</p>\n<p>To address this problem, over the summer I developed a centralized remote procedure call (RPC) server binary for MUI. This server handles all interactions with the full-featured Manticore Python API and handles MUI functionality through individual RPCs defined in a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protocol buffer</a>. We chose to use <a href=\"https://grpc.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gRPC</a> as our RPC framework because of its performance, wide adoption, and strong support for code generation across many programming languages. As a result, MUI plugins of the future can easily contain and depend on their own gRPC-generated code.</p>\n<p>The server is written in Python, providing it access to the full functionality of Manticore’s Python API, but is bundled into a shiv binary that can be called in any language. This facilitates a new client-server architecture that allows developers to implement any back-end Manticore functionality and tests just once. Developers of the front-end disassembler plugins can make RPC requests to the server with just a few lines of trivial code, which means that their work on individual plugins can focus almost entirely on front-end/UI changes.</p>\n<p>To alleviate the “chore” of handling fixed strings and other front-end information that will be identical across plugins, we can store such data in JSON files that are packaged with MUI plugin releases and loaded on startup. In this way, we can standardize data such as the fields, field descriptors, and default values of the run dialogs used to start Manticore’s execution.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103454\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103454\" data-attachment-id=\"103454\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/fixed_data/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=1600%2C1159&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1159\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fixed_data\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Fixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=690%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103454\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=690%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1024%2C742&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=768%2C556&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1536%2C1113&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1200%2C869&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.</p></div>\n<h2>Demo: Developing a Feature for MUI</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the process of developing a feature for MUI. Suppose that we want to enable manual state management during the runtime of a Manticore instance. Specifically, we want the ability to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pause</strong> a state and <strong>resume</strong> it at a later time, which will be useful if we implement capabilities like execution tracing in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Kill</strong> a state at our discretion. That way, if a state bypasses an <code>avoid</code> hook or becomes stuck in an infinite loop, we will be able to abandon it.First, we will define a new RPC and the RPC’s message formats in our protocol buffer file. The server will receive the state’s numeric ID, the Manticore instance that we’re working with, and a <code>StateAction</code> enum indicating whether it should resume, pause, or kill the state.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_103456\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103456\" data-attachment-id=\"103456\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/rpc_details/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=1534%2C1124&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1534,1124\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"RPC_details\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Details of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=690%2C505&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103456\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=690%2C505&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=1024%2C750&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=768%2C563&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=1200%2C879&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?w=1534&amp;ssl=1 1534w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103456\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Details of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.</p></div>\n<p>We’ll also need to update an existing message—<code>ManticoreStateList</code>.

In our plugins, we encapsulate all such “connector” functions in a single file. In the Ghidra plugin, writing a connector function involves only three steps. First, we create a <code>StreamObserver</code> object to asynchronously handle RPC responses. In this case, we need only implement behavior for handling error cases, since the “results” of successful <code>ControlState</code> RPCs will be available to the user via the <code>GetStateList</code> RPC. Then we build the <code>ControlStateRequest</code> object, populating the fields as required. Lastly, we actually execute the RPC through a method exposed by the gRPC-generated <code>ManticoreServerStub</code>, which conveniently handles all communication with the server for us.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103468\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103468\" data-attachment-id=\"103468\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/connector_method/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=1600%2C1474&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1474\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"connector_method\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=690%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103468\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=690%2C635&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"635\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1024%2C943&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=768%2C708&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1536%2C1415&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1200%2C1106&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103468\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.</p></div>\n<p>The only thing left to do is to make the appropriate UI changes!

While symbolic execution is a powerful technique that can augment the vulnerability discovery process, it requires some base domain knowledge and thus has its own learning curve. Given the plethora of ways in which a user can interact with such an engine and the need for frequent context switching between a disassembler and one’s terminal or script editor, integrating symbolic execution into one’s workflow can be daunting for a beginner.\nOne of the ways Trail of Bits has sought to ease this process is by making graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Manticore that are embedded in popular interactive disassemblers. Last summer, former intern Alan Chang worked on the first such interface, the Manticore User Interface (MUI) plugin for Binary Ninja. We found that pairing Manticore directly with an interactive disassembler provides vulnerability researchers with a more convenient way to actually use (and benefit from) symbolic execution. Therefore, during my winter and summer internships at Trail of Bits, my goal was to help grow the MUI ecosystem by making a MUI plugin for Ghidra and building infrastructure to make these plugins easier to use, maintain, and develop.\n\nThe gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.\n\nThe Ghidra Plugin\nWe figured that the most direct way to encourage more people to use MUI plugins would be to simply develop MUI plugins for a greater variety of disassemblers! Thus, I spent my winternship developing a Ghidra version of the MUI plugin; I chose Ghidra chiefly because it is popular and, unlike the commercial tool Binary Ninja, free and open source. Additionally, a few internal projects at Trail of Bits were already using Ghidra, so I would have ample opportunity to explore Ghidra plugin development. Finally, by developing a Ghidra plugin (one written in Java instead of Python), we could develop a solution that wouldn’t be tied to a single programming language, gaining insight that could guide the development of future plugins.\nThis initial Ghidra plugin mimicked the existing Binary Ninja plugin as closely as possible. While it took a bit of time to become familiar with Java Swing and Ghidra’s widgets, simply mimicking the existing visual components and user interface was a fairly trivial task once I got going.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.\n\nHowever, because the Ghidra plugin would be written in Java, it could not depend on the Manticore Python package or directly call Manticore’s Python API. Our solution to that challenge was to use a tool called shiv to seamlessly bundle the Manticore library and all of its dependencies into a Python zipapp. That way, we could create a “batteries-included” Manticore binary and then translate the Binary Ninja plugin’s interactions with the Manticore API into the appropriate command-line arguments. We then placed this binary in the relevant platform-specific subdirectories of Ghidra’s os directory, which facilitates cross-platform support.\nBy the end of the winternship, I was able to add extra features to the Ghidra plugin, such as the ability to specify arbitrary Manticore arguments in addition to those with dedicated input fields and support for multiple Manticore instances in the same Ghidra session. This, however, brought to light an additional problem.\nFeature parity and cross-disassembler development\nIt quickly became apparent that our approach to plugin development would not be sustainable if we aspired to expand the MUI project to support even more disassemblers. For each new MUI feature, we would first have to determine how to implement the feature, accounting for the way that the plugin interacts with Manticore (e.g., through direct calls to the Manticore API or through Manticore’s command-line interface options). Furthermore, certain front-end information shared across plugins (e.g., fixed description strings or sensible default options) would have to be repeated and standardized in each implementation.\nTo address this problem, over the summer I developed a centralized remote procedure call (RPC) server binary for MUI. This server handles all interactions with the full-featured Manticore Python API and handles MUI functionality through individual RPCs defined in a protocol buffer. We chose to use gRPC as our RPC framework because of its performance, wide adoption, and strong support for code generation across many programming languages. As a result, MUI plugins of the future can easily contain and depend on their own gRPC-generated code.\nThe server is written in Python, providing it access to the full functionality of Manticore’s Python API, but is bundled into a shiv binary that can be called in any language. This facilitates a new client-server architecture that allows developers to implement any back-end Manticore functionality and tests just once. Developers of the front-end disassembler plugins can make RPC requests to the server with just a few lines of trivial code, which means that their work on individual plugins can focus almost entirely on front-end/UI changes.\nTo alleviate the “chore” of handling fixed strings and other front-end information that will be identical across plugins, we can store such data in JSON files that are packaged with MUI plugin releases and loaded on startup. In this way, we can standardize data such as the fields, field descriptors, and default values of the run dialogs used to start Manticore’s execution.\n\nFixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.\n\nDemo: Developing a Feature for MUI\nLet’s take a look at the process of developing a feature for MUI. Suppose that we want to enable manual state management during the runtime of a Manticore instance. Specifically, we want the ability to do the following:\nPause a state and resume it at a later time, which will be useful if we implement capabilities like execution tracing in the future.\nKill a state at our discretion. That way, if a state bypasses an avoid hook or becomes stuck in an infinite loop, we will be able to abandon it.First, we will define a new RPC and the RPC’s message formats in our protocol buffer file. The server will receive the state’s numeric ID, the Manticore instance that we’re working with, and a StateAction enum indicating whether it should resume, pause, or kill the state.\n\nDetails of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.\n\nWe’ll also need to update an existing message—ManticoreStateList. MUI plugins have state lists that display all states and the status of each state; these lists are updated via a GetStateList RPC. Because it’d be beneficial for users to see “paused” states as distinct from preexisting state statuses, we’ll add a new paused_states field to the RPC’s response message, which will contain a list of the states paused by the user.\n\nThe existing ManticoreStateList message is updated with a new paused_states attribute.\n\nWith that, we can proceed to generate the Python service interface code and mypy type stubs! During my summer internship, I used the command runner just to abstract away this work for developers, so we can run the just generate command to…just generate the required code!\nNow we can move on to implementing the back-end functionality. This code is contained in a single Servicer class in which each method represents an individual RPC.\nWe’ll begin by validating the RPC request data. While gRPC-generated code can check that the fields provided to it are correctly typed, it cannot enforce the use of any fields or verify that fields are well formed. Thus, we’ll write our own checks to assert the validity of the request; we’ll also set an error code and error details to be returned to the requester if the request is invalid.\n\nCode added to the back-end server validates the incoming RPC request.\n\nFinally, we can implement the state-pausing and state-killing functionality by directly accessing Manticore’s Python API. This direct access provides us far more control than we’d have if we were interacting with Manticore through its command-line options, enabling us to create a dummy busy state or abandon a specific state, for example. If all goes well, the front-end plugin will receive an empty response, which will be populated with the default OK status code.\n\nOnce the state has been successfully processed, an empty response object is returned.\n\nOne additional benefit of our approach is that we can write tests for our RPCs without having to deal with spawning up a server and connecting to it. Instead, we can simply call the Servicer’s methods directly and pass in a new Context object, which we can later inspect for error codes.\n\nWriting tests is as simple as directly calling the Servicer’s methods.\n\nOnce we’re done, we can use our trusty command runner to “just build” the shiv binary, which will give us a fresh server binary that we can use in our plugins.\nFirst, we need to generate the Java service interface code, which will be based on the updated protocol buffer. gRPC maintains a Java library, grpc-java, that will handle this for us.\nThen, we have to write the function that actually executes the RPC. In our plugins, we encapsulate all such “connector” functions in a single file. In the Ghidra plugin, writing a connector function involves only three steps. First, we create a StreamObserver object to asynchronously handle RPC responses. In this case, we need only implement behavior for handling error cases, since the “results” of successful ControlState RPCs will be available to the user via the GetStateList RPC. Then we build the ControlStateRequest object, populating the fields as required. Lastly, we actually execute the RPC through a method exposed by the gRPC-generated ManticoreServerStub, which conveniently handles all communication with the server for us.\n\nThe new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.\n\nThe only thing left to do is to make the appropriate UI changes! For this feature, we can simply open a context menu by right-clicking on a state in the state list and then populate the state with the actions that call the controlState method!\n\nThe added code creates a new option in the context menu and calls the “connector” method when that new option is selected.\n\n\nWith the Manticore functionality handled by the gRPC server, the UI changes that we must implement on the “front ends” of the Ghidra and Binary Ninja plugins are fairly straightforward.\n\nThe “hypothetical” state management feature discussed in the demo has actually been implemented and is now part of MUI! If you’re interested in seeing all of the changes and commits, check out the pull requests for the server and the Ghidra plugin. ( These pull requests were made before a refactor of where this code lives. The code now lives in the main Manticore repository under the server directory.)\nA Quick Step-by-Step Guide\nTo summarize, the steps for adding a new feature to MUI are as follows:\nStart by modifying the MUI Server binary.\nEdit the protocol buffer (the ManticoreServer.proto file) if new RPCs or modifications to existing messages are required.\nGenerate service interface code for the server script by running the just generate command.\nAdd the functionality and the request validation code to the server script (manticore_server.py), through which one can interact with the Manticore API directly.\nWhere applicable, write tests for the new functionality.\nBuild the shiv server executable by running the just build command.\nThen, for each front-end plugin:\nUse / copy over the new server binary;\nGenerate service interface code in the programming language used by the plugin; and\nMake any relevant front-end changes (and, where applicable, share standardized data as part of MUI’s common resources).\nConclusion\nMy internships at Trail of Bits have been really fulfilling, and I’m proud of how the MUI project has progressed.

Hash rate had grown throughout the summer as publicly-traded Bitcoin miners continued to add capacity via mining rigs pre-ordered during the bull market.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"731\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:731,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em><a href=\"https://charts.coinmetrics.io/formulas/#5041\">Source: Coin Metrics Network Data Pro</a></em></p><p>There&#8217;s a potentially interesting explanation behind the late September and October rise in hash rate: <a href=\"https://coinmetrics.io/special-insights/ethereum-merge/\">The Ethereum Merge</a>.

These \"one-hop\" addresses are typically controlled by individual miners contributing hash power to their mining pool of choice. Active miner addresses tend to peak just after Bitcoin price has topped, with slow-moving hardware deployments arriving late to the party as speculative enthusiasm begins to dwindle. Five months after the BTC price peaked in December 2017, monthly active miner addresses tipped 80,000, only to crash to lows near 10,000 in 2020.</p><p>This bull cycle, we didn't see nearly the same level of mining mania reflected in active addresses, potentially due to the consolidation of hash power into a smaller set of publicly-traded entities. However, in 2022 we've still seen the number of active mining addresses fall more than 50% from recent highs, reaching the lowest levels since 2011. Miner active addresses appeared to find a bottom in August, bouncing weakly back over the past few months, but activity could easily decline in December as major miners continue to file for bankruptcy.</p><p>Though the mining industry has matured significantly in the past few years, the continued trend of cyclical capitulation indicates the sector has some progress to make on proper risk management. While power-purchasing agreements enable miners to control exposure to rising energy prices, options for managing exposure to hashprice&#8212; a metric measuring USD-denominated revenue per unit of hashrate&#8212; are slim to none. To this end, mining service providers like Luxor Technologies have developed derivatives products for more sophisticated operations, allowing miners to hedge their exposure by selling hashprice <a href=\"https://hashrateindex.com/blog/luxor-technologies-launches-otc-bitcoin-mining-derivative/\">Non-Deliverable Forward</a> (NDF) contracts.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"704\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em><a href=\"https://luxor.tech/derivatives\">Source: Luxor Technologies</a></em></p><p>In the example scenario pictured above, a miner could use Luxor's NDF contract to hedge against a month-over-month decline in hashprice. Normally, a drop in hashprice would simply result in a loss of revenue&#8212; however, if a miner sold 1,500 NDF contracts at $90 per PH/s/day, they'd effectively lock-in revenue at this threshold. Thirty days later, the miner settles the contract at a hashprice of $70 per PH/s/day, netting a $30K profit and offsetting a broader decline in mining revenue.</p><p>While Luxor's hashprice marketplace is still in its early stages, hashrate derivatives will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in managing miner risk, especially as the industry continues to attract capital allocators from more traditional sectors.</p><h3>Foundry Hammers the Competition</h3><p>With the collapse of Poolin and the unprecedented growth of the U.S. mining industry, Foundry USA Pool has aggressively expanded its share of the Bitcoin hashrate. While <a href=\"https://coinmetrics.substack.com/i/75132155/poolin-goes-off-the-deep-end\">the Poolin episode</a> serves as a healthy reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the mining pool ecosystem, the migration of hashrate has furthered the dominance of the top 3 mining pools, with Foundry, AntPool, and F2Pool collectively controlling well over 50% of market share. Foundry&#8217;s place in the top 3 is especially noteworthy, with the American mining pool overtaking the longstanding leadership of Asia-based pools at the beginning of 2022.</p><div

href=\"https://coinmetrics.io/atlas/\">Source: Coin Metrics ATLAS</a></em></p><p>Foundry&#8217;s lack of empty blocks serves as a testament to the pool&#8217;s block templating prowess. In the split seconds after a block is mined, mining pools scramble to assemble a new block template, selecting the highest-paying transactions for inclusion in their next attempt at solving the Proof-of-Work. During this short period, pools continue to throw off hashrate, meaning there&#8217;s a small chance of a block being mined before a transaction-bearing template is fully assembled.</p><p>So far in 2022, Foundry has constructed block templates quickly enough to beat the clock. With the <a href=\"https://braiins.com/stratum-v2\">upcoming release</a> of Stratum V2, however, individual miners will soon have the option of assembling their own templates, cutting mining pool-middlemen out of the transaction selection process. Whether this will affect the frequency of empty blocks&#8212; and how that will impact the mining pool landscape&#8212; still remains to be seen.</p><h3>Waves in the Mempool</h3><p>Through the latter half of 2022, the mempool has remained relatively muted, with the exception of a prolonged period of congestion in mid-November.

To catch up on our other quarterly mining reviews from this year, check out the links below.\nSOTN’s 2022 Quarterly Mining Specials: Q1, Q2, Q3 \nBitcoin hash rate continued to push higher throughout most of Q4 in spite of a subdued spot BTC price. Hash rate — a proxy for the total amount of computational effort securing the network — hit as high as 250 EH/s (quintillion hashes per second) in late October, an all-time high. Hash rate had grown throughout the summer as publicly-traded Bitcoin miners continued to add capacity via mining rigs pre-ordered during the bull market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics Network Data Pro\nThere’s a potentially interesting explanation behind the late September and October rise in hash rate: The Ethereum Merge. As independent crypto researcher Data Always has suggested, the end of Ethereum mining likely incentivized operators to repurpose industrial rack space, swapping out GPUs used to mine Ethereum with ASICs used to mine Bitcoin. It’s hard to put an exact figure on the magnitude of this resource reallocation, but Bitcoin hash rate grew quickly from 220 EH/s to 250 EH/s shortly after the completion of The Merge in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: “The Merge and crypto's electricity consumption” by Data Always\nHowever, with the price of spot BTC facing renewed downward pressure in the wake of FTX’s failures, hash rate has started to slide. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty — a network parameter that automatically adjusts every 2 weeks to keep block times in check — decreased by more than 7% recently (see first chart above), the biggest decrease since miners abruptly exited China in spring 2021. \nThe stagnation in hash rate is a sign that miners are facing a new round of challenges amid wary market conditions.\nSigns of Miner Capitulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Coin Metrics ATLAS & Reference Rates \nOne proxy we can use to monitor mining activity is the number of Bitcoin addresses receiving payouts directly from mining pools. These \"one-hop\" addresses are typically controlled by individual miners contributing hash power to their mining pool of choice. Active miner addresses tend to peak just after Bitcoin price has topped, with slow-moving hardware deployments arriving late to the party as speculative enthusiasm begins to dwindle. Five months after the BTC price peaked in December 2017, monthly active miner addresses tipped 80,000, only to crash to lows near 10,000 in 2020.\nThis bull cycle, we didn't see nearly the same level of mining mania reflected in active addresses, potentially due to the consolidation of hash power into a smaller set of publicly-traded entities. However, in 2022 we've still seen the number of active mining addresses fall more than 50% from recent highs, reaching the lowest levels since 2011. Miner active addresses appeared to find a bottom in August, bouncing weakly back over the past few months, but activity could easily decline in December as major miners continue to file for bankruptcy.\nThough the mining industry has matured significantly in the past few years, the continued trend of cyclical capitulation indicates the sector has some progress to make on proper risk management. While power-purchasing agreements enable miners to control exposure to rising energy prices, options for managing exposure to hashprice— a metric measuring USD-denominated revenue per unit of hashrate— are slim to none. To this end, mining service providers like Luxor Technologies have developed derivatives products for more sophisticated operations, allowing miners to hedge their exposure by selling hashprice Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Luxor Technologies\nIn the example scenario pictured above, a miner could use Luxor's NDF contract to hedge against a month-over-month decline in hashprice. Normally, a drop in hashprice would simply result in a loss of revenue— however, if a miner sold 1,500 NDF contracts at $90 per PH/s/day, they'd effectively lock-in revenue at this threshold. Thirty days later, the miner settles the contract at a hashprice of $70 per PH/s/day, netting a $30K profit and offsetting a broader decline in mining revenue.\nWhile Luxor's hashprice marketplace is still in its early stages, hashrate derivatives will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in managing miner risk, especially as the industry continues to attract capital allocators from more traditional sectors.\nFoundry Hammers the Competition\nWith the collapse of Poolin and the unprecedented growth of the U.S. mining industry, Foundry USA Pool has aggressively expanded its share of the Bitcoin hashrate. While the Poolin episode serves as a healthy reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the mining pool ecosystem, the migration of hashrate has furthered the dominance of the top 3 mining pools, with Foundry, AntPool, and F2Pool collectively controlling well over 50% of market share. Foundry’s place in the top 3 is especially noteworthy, with the American mining pool overtaking the longstanding leadership of Asia-based pools at the beginning of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics ATLAS\nInterestingly, Foundry has also managed to maintain its foothold as the dominant mining pool without mining a single empty block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics ATLAS\nFoundry’s lack of empty blocks serves as a testament to the pool’s block templating prowess. In the split seconds after a block is mined, mining pools scramble to assemble a new block template, selecting the highest-paying transactions for inclusion in their next attempt at solving the Proof-of-Work. During this short period, pools continue to throw off hashrate, meaning there’s a small chance of a block being mined before a transaction-bearing template is fully assembled.\nSo far in 2022, Foundry has constructed block templates quickly enough to beat the clock. With the upcoming release of Stratum V2, however, individual miners will soon have the option of assembling their own templates, cutting mining pool-middlemen out of the transaction selection process. Whether this will affect the frequency of empty blocks— and how that will impact the mining pool landscape— still remains to be seen.\nWaves in the Mempool\nThrough the latter half of 2022, the mempool has remained relatively muted, with the exception of a prolonged period of congestion in mid-November. A massive flood of 12-15 sat/vB transactions (allegedly due to a Binance cold wallet consolidation) resulted in a substantial spike in the average mining reward, with F2Pool netting over 0.73 BTC in transaction fees for a single block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics FARUM\nOf course, it wouldn't be a Bitcoin bear market without a bit of vicious community in-fighting about seemingly minor technical details. Casual users of Bitcoin likely haven’t even heard of Replace-by-Fee (RBF), a unique transaction type that allows users the option to re-broadcast a prior on-chain payment with a slightly higher fee.\nReplace-by-Fee was designed to help relieve mempool pressure in periods of congestion, allowing users to bump transactions up the priority queue in exchange for a slightly higher tip to miners. However, members of Bitcoin’s business community warn the feature is easy to abuse— users can also “reverse” 0-confirmation transactions by re-broadcasting a payment and substituting their own address as the recipient. For merchants unsuspectingly accepting malicious 0-conf transactions, this effectively amounts to a double-spend, increasing the risk of chargeback fraud.\nSince their introduction in 2016, RBF-enabled transactions have become increasingly common. However, with the controversial release of Bitcoin Core 24.0, Replace-by-Fee is now the default setting for node mempools. While this change has seen plenty of pushback from the merchant community, developers stand firmly behind the upgrade, arguing that 0-confirmations have never been safe to accept in the first place. If you want instant settlement, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is a better option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: txstats.coinmetrics.io\nIn any case, miners have little direct incentive to worry about the potential for Replace-by-Fee fraud. Higher fees simply boost miner’s bottom line, no matter where they come from. Nonetheless, the increased complexity of monitoring RBF transactions could also make block templating significantly more difficult, forcing miners to keep their finger on the pulse of the mempool more than ever before.\nBetter Hashing Days Ahead?\nMiners have had a tough year and a particularly hard Q4. Looking to 2023, there are plenty of outstanding questions that will dictate the direction of the Bitcoin mining industry beyond just the price of BTC. \nWith the expansion of the industry’s US footprint, mining is being analyzed differently by various jurisdictions. In November, New York enacted a first of its kind two-year moratorium on new mining operations in the state. Meanwhile, as Texas prepares for winter, the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) recently reported 1.7 gigawatts (GW) worth of Large Flexible Loads primarily composed of Bitcoin miners to help state grid operators manage periods of high demand. The interactions between miners and governments at the local, state, and possibly federal level could continue to accelerate in 2023. \nOn the operational side, miners will likely need to continue to monitor input costs in the face of higher industrial electricity rates. Large operators with competitive rates in advantageous locations optimizing over every variable are poised to succeed in this environment. Further maturation and technical upgrades next year could benefit the ecosystem, such as the impending launch of Stratum V2.\nThere are plenty of challenges, but in the face of it all miners continue to hash away, securing the chain while cleverly positioning operations for success and survival.\nCoin Metrics Updates\nThis week’s updates from the Coin Metrics team:\n\nJoin us on The Mining Pod on December 21st, where we’ll provide a recap of Bitcoin mining data in 2022.\n\nWe're excited to be growing our data and research-focused community on gm.xyz, come join the conversation!\n\nCheck out our market-data focused newsletter State of the Market, featuring weekly updates on market conditions and news across the crypto ecosystem.\n\nAs always, if you have any feedback or requests please let us know here.\nSubscribe and Past Issues\nCoin Metrics’ State of the Network, is an unbiased, weekly view of the crypto market informed by our own network (on-chain) and market data.\nIf you'd like to get State of the Network in your inbox, please subscribe here.

They were great for our business and even better for our understanding. Of course we expect every feature to boost usage, but we couldn’t have anticipated the growth yielded by those two features. And the correlation was easy to analyze: both features directly implement a vision of the P2P economy.</p><p>The P2P economy refers to disintermediated exchange, like creative people trading the fruits of their creativity — podcasts, videos, fanfic novels, 3D-printed cosplay accessories — with users for cash, without the intervention of banks, payment processors, or aggregators.</p><p>Each intermediary in an interaction induces friction and increases the distance from the desired experience, and they can’t help it. Banks have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Aggregation platforms have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Payment processors have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit.</p><p>Notice the pattern? While each intermediary claims to be giving users what they want, they’re actually serving different groups who want different things at the same time. That intermediaries always take a cut, induce friction, and increase the distance between people and experiences isn’t the result of bad management or evil intentions, it’s just the nature of the beast.</p><p>So why not create something far better for users? Let people interact directly, pay each other directly, exchange goods and services directly. There are even services out there — social networks, messaging services, content aggregators, gaming platforms — that would like to facilitate exchanges among their users, but they can’t because legacy intermediaries induce too much (financial, regulatory, UX) friction. Worse still, the centralization induced by these large data networks increases their power over each user and, therefore, increases the risk of abuse to all users.</p><p>The P2P economy isn’t some billionaire’s pipe dream; it describes a world where we’re closer to the experiences we value and to each other.

While both of those functions are in the Breez app, they feel like their own little self-contained interfaces, tailor-made for their respective purposes (or as close as we could get with the technological limitations of running a node on a phone).</p><p>But you can only cram so many activities and experiences into a <a href=\"https://medium.com/breez-technology/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-lightning-wallet-dc9ac46d32\">non-custodial Lightning payment app</a>. And however clever, charming, and good looking a team behind the payment app may be, they’re not necessarily best placed to devise new ways of applying P2P payments to new types of experience. We know how to make Lightning mobile and how to improve its UX, but when it comes to commerce, music, video streaming, or any other vertical solution, experts in those fields know better how to craft the best experience.</p><p>Indeed, the POS mode and the podcast player are just scratching the surface of what’s possible. We implemented them according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\">the KISS principle</a>. Though they have scaled remarkably and attracted thousands of new users, they’re basically demo versions implemented to showcase how people interface with the P2P economy.</p><p>Could others with fine-grained expertise of those and other kinds of experience come up with better ways to apply P2P money to P2P interaction? <em>Of course they could</em>. And would those better applications achieve scale that our neophyte, outsider attempts never could? <em>Absolutely</em>.</p><p>And that’s the point. The better we apply the tech, the closer people get to the experiences they want, the more they will use the tech, the faster Lightning will scale. The scale we’re aiming for is not X orders of magnitude; we’re shooting for a world where kids roll their eyes whenever an adult says “Back in the fiat days…”</p><p>Achieving scale is a matter of reducing friction, and multiple, tailor-made apps that apply Lightning technology optimally to life’s many worthwhile pursuits is the best way of minimizing friction and expanding the P2P economy. It’s not about making the best wallet that can do everything; it’s about adapting Lightning — the means — to whatever ends users want and whatever kind of experience they want in exchange.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*VAZ6woKIBYlUtlWA\" /><figcaption>(Image: <a href=\"https://singularityhub.com/2016/04/05/how-to-think-exponentially-and-better-predict-the-future/\">Alison E. Berman</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>LaaS Liberates Lightning</h3><p>Those who understand the technical requirements of running a non-custodial Lightning app will have realized already that adapting Lightning payments to any number of existing and yet-unimagined applications is incompatible with running a node in a single app. Lightning is far too technically demanding to scale the P2P economy as we have described it. Running the kind of always-on node required is an experience that few users, developers, creators, or vendors out there will relish.</p><p>We’re envisioning, inventing, and realizing <strong>Lightning as a Service </strong>(LaaS). LaaS is about using Lightning to remove friction from life, from the experiences we crave. The point isn’t to improve the user experience <em>in the app</em>, but to improve the users’ experience <em>of Lightning as a whole</em> that gives them more value in their lives.</p><p>And LaaS is doable. As Breez envisions it, LaaS has three major components, the first of which is in development, the second has an alpha set to launch in a couple of months, and the third exists already and just needs to scale:</p><h4>A Lightning SDK</h4><p>As it stands, anyone seeking to integrate Lightning payments to their existing business faces a steep learning curve. Accepting payments over Lightning requires them to run a node, secure liquidity with an LSP, manage fiat exchanges, perform swaps on and off the Bitcoin blockchain, manage a wallet, and so on. A non-custodial SDK would give P2P entrepreneurs and existing web utilities access to those functions without having to start from scratch.</p><p>With a well-designed SDK, developers will be able to select the Lightning functions they need from a menu and integrate them quickly and easily into their own applications. Instead of having to learn the Lightning tech stack, a Lightning SDK will let developers simply plug it into their own tech stacks.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-Sgz6UfiUL-LHU1s\" /></figure><h4>Hybrid architecture</h4><p>Lightning needs to be immediately available wherever and whenever people want to make payments. Locking a user’s functionality into a single app or on a single device would require the user to adapt to the technology, which is backwards. That’s friction.</p><p>At the same time, though, KYC friction and global, cross-market expansion requires a peer-to-peer, non-custodial solution. As soon as LSPs start acting like banks, regulators will start treating them like banks. That’s friction too.</p><p>The solution is a hybrid architecture based on <a href=\"https://medium.com/breez-technology/get-ready-for-a-fresh-breez-multiple-apps-one-node-optimal-ux-519c4daf2536\">sovereign remote nodes</a>, but that locates those nodes in the cloud rather than on users’ local devices. To deliver both optimal user sovereignty with a next-gen UX, we’ve partnered with Blockstream and their <a href=\"https://blog.blockstream.com/en-greenlight-by-blockstream-lightning-made-easy/\">Greenlight product</a>. Any service can access these nodes from any device, but as long as the users’ keys are locally stored, users maintain custody of their own funds, minimizing the operators’ regulatory profile.</p><p>P2P + minimal friction = scale.</p><h4>Decentralizing liquidity</h4><p>There is no credit on Lightning. The liquidity to settle any transaction needs to be preloaded onto the network. While this imposes a significant liquidity burden on those seeking to process users’ payments, it also presents the rich opportunity of a snowball effect: the more liquidity the network contains, the more transactions it can process, the more transaction fees the operators can collect, the more liquidity they have to invest in the network, and so on.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.lynalden.com/lightning-network/\">Lyn Alden</a> recently put it,</p><blockquote>Once there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of participants, and with larger average channel balances, then routing a payment from any arbitrary point to any other arbitrary point on the network becomes exponentially easier and more reliable.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xIHhDYxMFyFXI3iN\" /><figcaption>Ironically, snowballs are only possible when water is frozen, i.e. <em>not liquid</em>.
