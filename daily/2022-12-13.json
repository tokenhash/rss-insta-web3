Digital：去中心化保险赛道现状研究\n【观点】NFT 平台 Blur 未来还能走多远？\n【研究】读懂 Rage Trade：可组合的全链以太坊永续合约协议\n🌞 Web3 行研早报：每日早晨 9 点 30 分获取 web3 行业必读资讯，更多信息可浏览 chainfeeds.xyz，⏰ 欢迎订阅 ChainFeeds Telegram Channel 获取及时提醒\n🎫 Dragonfly Capital 合伙人：Genesis 清算或将迫使 DCG 破产\n\nDragonfly Capital 管理合伙人 Haseeb Qureshi 在 Unchained 节目中表示，Genesis 债权人可能会要求 DCG 赎回 Genesis 价值 11 亿美元的十年期票据，而这将引发 DCG 的流动性枯竭从而导致其破产。长时间的沉默可能表明 Genesis 债权人正在给 DCG 时间来解决这个问题。\n\nRyan Selkis（Messari 创始人）: 在第二季度和第三季度，Genesis 解除了超过 100 亿美元的贷款合同。鉴于 Alameda 和 Genesis 是最大的两个加密借贷方，他们很可能有贷款。看起来 Genesis 正在负责任地减少他们的很多头寸并取消借贷，如今 Alameda 或 FTX 似乎不是 Genesis 的债权人。如果这是真的，那么这两个巨头要么没有关系（不太可能），要么他们平仓了。【原文为英文】（ 来源 ）\n\n🩸 Nansen 创始人：2023 年将是针对加密初创公司的一场大屠杀\n\nNansen 创始人 Alex Svanevik 发推表示，2023 年将是针对加密初创公司的一场大屠杀：1）大多数 21/22 年的种子初创公司资金耗尽；2）一些公司被收购；3）只有少数公司能进行新一轮融资（ > 80% 融资估值较前一轮下降）；4）技术人员工资下降；5）技术职位缩水；6）VC 转而投资其他领域（人工智能等）。\n\nPaul Salisbury MRKL.eth: 不会崩溃的加密初创公司需要拥有：一个对于加密持有者（而非投机者）简单易懂的产品；商业模式不依赖交易量和代币价格；健康的单位员工收入比率（Revenue Per Employee）；关注安全性。【原文为英文】（ 来源 ）\n\n🗣️ 路透社：美国司法部对是否就币安涉嫌无证汇款、洗钱、违反制裁采取行动产生分歧\n\nReuters: 知情人士表示，调查始于 2018 年，重点是币安对美国反洗钱法和制裁的遵守情况。此外，最近几个月，币安在美国律师事务所 Gibson Dunn 的辩护律师与司法部官员举行了会议，讨论包括潜在的认罪协议。【原文为英文】（ 来源 ）\nDuo Nine: 如何针对币安制造 FUD？从 2018 年获取新闻，回收，然后在 2022 年将其变成突发新闻，作为对 FTX 崩溃的报复。（暗讽 CoinDesk 标题比路透社原标题更 FUD）【原文为英文】（ 来源 ）\n\n🤑 A&T View：以太坊质押可提取价值中的投资机会\n\nLiam（ANT Capital）: Validator Captured Value 是「浮在水面上的价值」，这个市场相对成熟，各利益相关者提取价值的比例也相对固定。最显而易见的两个投资方向是 Validator Infra Provider 和 Stake Pool。不过，DVT（Distributed Validator Technology）的成熟和应用会成为新的「鲶鱼」。（ 来源 ）\nLiam（ANT Capital）: Validator Uncaptured Value 是「藏在水面下的价值」，由于涉及到 External MEV Market（Off-chain）并没有那么透明。一个需要被信任、且集中化的市场不是我们希望看到的。能够优化 External MEV Market 的商业化解决方案会是值得关注的投资机会。（ 来源 ）\n\n🏦 Delphi Digital：去中心化保险赛道现状研究，增长缓慢的原因以及机制创新\n\nJoo Kian（Delphi Digital 研究员）: 尽管 DeFi 的 TVL 在增长，黑客事件也创下新高，但保险业并没有什么增长。高峰期所有 DeFi TVL 中只有 1.2% 受保险协议保护，近几个月只占总 TVL 的 0.7% 到 1% 之间。目前只有 2.35 亿美元的 TVL 受保险协议保护，而整个市场有 408 亿美元。即使按照 200% 的保障率（总保障金额 / TVL）来算，也只能为总 TVL 的 1.15% 提供保险服务。此外，按索赔金额排名前五的事件来看，保险所覆盖的平均损失只有 6.47%。（ 来源 ）\nJoo Kian（Delphi Digital 研究员）: DeFi 保险发展缓慢的核心原因主要在于加密投资者的风险偏好、「经过实战考验的」协议、购买保险的成本降低了收益率以及资本存在轮换周期。同时，保险协议的高风险低回报、定价、风险暴露以及缺乏整合等问题导致了承保积极性下降。可以通过自动保险和提前终止机制或协议购买保险等方法进行改善。（ 来源 ）\nJoo Kian（Delphi Digital 研究员）: Y2K Finance 推出的「Earthquake」以三种稳定币（USDC、USDT 和 MIM）为中心，具有不同执行价格，每周或每月到期。运作方式是为保险买家提供一个「Hedge Vault」，为保险卖家提供一个「Risk Vault」，根据是否脱钩进行赔付，不需要依靠评估索赔的有效性。（ 来源 ）\n\n🐵 APE 开启质押奖励，如何选择参与平台？\n\nJamesX（iZUMi Research）: ApeStake.io 官方质押划分为 4 个互相独立的质押池：APE 代币池、BAYC 池、MAYC 池和 BAKC 配对池。 APE 池可以直接质押任意数量的 APE 代币；而 BAYC 和 MAYC 池，NFT 更像是一个盛装 APE 代币的容器，需要 APE 代币与其配对参与 APE Staking 挖矿，且每个 NFT 都有 APE 代币配对上限。BAKC 池则必须先与一个 BAYC/MAYC 配对，才能配合 APE 代币参与质押。（ 来源 ）\nJamesX（iZUMi Research）: ParaSpace 的 Ape NFT 持有者在平台质押 NFT 后，可以从 APE 借贷池中借出所需配对的 APE 代币，无需找到特定的 APE 代币持有者，让其把代币质押配对给自己的 NFT，极大的降低了市场摩擦。同时，APE 代币持有者只需向 ParaSpace 借贷池中存入 APE 代币，就可以借贷利率形式获得 APE Staking 激励。（ 来源 ）\nJamesX（iZUMi Research）: BendDAO 采取了用户自由度更高的 Peer-to-Peer 模式。每一个 BAYC/MAYC 存入 BendApe Staking 时，NFT 持有者可以自由设定几个参数：1）Ape NFT、APE 代币、BAKC 配对质押者几个角色分得的 APE 代币奖励占比；2）APE 代币质押的数量要求。APE 代币持有者可以选择任意一个 Ape NFT 进行配对质押，但最重要的选择依据肯定是 Ape NFT 持有者预先设定的奖励分配比率。（ 来源 ）\nJamesX（iZUMi Research）: Binance NFT 的活动规则是最简单直接的，用户只需在 Binance NFT 平台质押 BAYC 和 MAYC NFT，即可获得每日的 APE 代币挖矿奖励。相当于为 Ape NFT 持有者提供了一个中心化质押服务，用户无需担心 APE 代币的配对质押规则，便可在 Ape Staking 活动中获得收益。可以选择以活期形式或 30 天、60 天、90 天的固定期限质押 BAYC 或 MAYC NFT。（ 来源 ）\n\n🚂 NFT 平台 Blur 未来还能走多远？\n\nBlockBeats: Blur 有几点问题：首先是 Blur 的第二轮空投活动仍在进行，该轮空投活动正激励用户在 Blur 尽可能以较低的价格上架流动性高的 NFT；然后有相当一部分的交易，可能是因为「低版税」乃至「零版税」而在 Blur 上发生。（ 来源 ）\nBlockBeats: 将聚合器作为市场的流量导入器固然很好，但后续面临的挑战也是严峻的，例如 OpenSea 麾下的 Gem，想必会努力缩小用户体验上的差距，夺回聚合器赛道的头把交易，Blur 需要一直保持他们的差异化优势核心 ——「快」，此外，Blur 自身的盈利模式也尚未明晰，目前，Blur 不收手续费，但官方没有承诺永远免费。（ 来源 ）\nBlockBeats: Blur 的成功对于 NFT 而言是利大于弊，Blur 的成功关键是过硬的产品，好产品越多，NFT 市场当然越进步，但也许「零版税」让中小创作者 / 项目方变得更加艰难，但这不是 Blur 的错，它只是顺应了市场。（ 来源 ）\n\n🏃🏻‍♀️ 2022 年加密支付赛道现状：需求仍在上升\n\n白泽研究院: 加密支付的主要用例包括：消费者向企业（C2B）支付，允许商家接受客户的加密货币支付，如 Coinbase Commerce；企业对企业支付（B2B），如 Syro 提供 B2B 支付和发票解决方案，利用 USDC 和 Celo 网络实现即时结算；NFT 支付；Web3 支付；汇款支付，如 TripleA 为汇款公司提供的加密货币与传统方式并行的支付方式。（ 来源 ）\n白泽研究院: 加密支付市场现状：1、尽管加密市场进入熊市，但加密支付的接受度正在上升。加密支付提供商 BitPay 处理的平均月度加密支付从 58,000 笔（2021）增加到 67,000 笔（2022），Paypal、Worldpay、Visa 和 Mastercard 等传统支付公司涉足加密支付；2、世界各地的公司都在接受加密支付。（ 来源 ）\n白泽研究院: 3、监管机构热衷于推动加密支付的采用。新加坡处于推动采用加密支付的最前沿，批准了 Circle 和 Paxos 的许可证，授权 Blockchain.com 和 Coinbase 在新提供支付服务，此外，英国（Crypto.com 和 Bottlepay）、俄罗斯（允许居民使用加密货币进行跨境支付）、美国科罗拉多州（将加密货币作为税款支付方式）、中非共和国（比特币作为法定货币）也动作频频。（ 来源 ）\n\n🧩 读懂 Rage Trade：可组合的全链以太坊永续合约协议\n\naididiaojp.eth: Rage Trade 创新点主要包括：1、全链可回收流动性，允许所有现有其他协议中的流动性资金进入，包括 AMM（如 Curve）、货币市场（如 Aave）、衍生品协议（如 GMX），这些流动性以 ETH-USD LP 的形式被整合到 80-20 Vaults 中，然后进入 Rage Trade 的 ETH Perp 流动性池。（ 来源 ）\naididiaojp.eth: 2、80-20 Vaults，这是 Rage ETH Perp 的 LP 运行策略，存入 Rage Trade 协议中的流动性，80% 仍将维持在外部协议如 Curve、GMX、Sushi 等中获得收益，最多为 Rage Trade 提供 20% 的集中流动性。（ 来源 ）\naididiaojp.eth: 3、Delta Neutral Vault，允许用户汇集资金，以 Delta Neutral 的方式（通过 Risk-Off Vault 和 Risk-On Vault 两个金库在 Aave 进行做空，减少对 ETH 和 BTC 的风险敞口）在 GMX 上提供流动性，同时在 GMX 上赚取 ETH 奖励。（ 来源 ）\nDovey Wan: Risk-On Vault 通过 GLP 赚取收益，同时在 Aave 上以 1.5 的健康比率（HR）存入稳定币借出 ETH 或 BTC 来对冲下行风险，但这也意味着 ETH 和 BTC 的价格瞬间飙升 50%，仓位将被清算。这个概率不高，如果价格移动 10% 或者 HR 下降到 1.3，Rage Trade 还会进行再平衡，但仍需考虑极端情况。【原文为英文】（ 来源 ）\nDovey Wan: Risk-Off Vault 允许用户存入可作为 Aave 抵押品的 USDC，回报包括 Aave 上的 Supply APR 和 Risk-On Vault 的部分 ETH 奖励。Delta Neutral Vault 的实际收益将取决于 Aave 利率、GLP 本身的奖励（动态变化）、Risk-Off Vault 中的资金利用率。【原文为英文】（ 来源 ）\n\n\nThanks for reading ChainFeeds Selection!
