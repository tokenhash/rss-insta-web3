Data Pipeline is a customized data source, or “connector,” built on <a href=\"https://airbyte.com/\">Airbyte</a>, which provides an ELT approach allowing users to select which KYVE data set to extract, load it onto their preferred backend, then transform it in whatever or however many ways they need for their use case.

For those wanting to code their own solution for sourcing KYVE data, they can do so via the REST-API.</p><h3>Data Access Via REST-API</h3><p>The REST-API is a resource model outlining the major details you need to know about a given piece of data. For example, where and how it’s being stored. For KYVE, its data is available through the REST-API exposed by its chain nodes. This integration is a native way to access data in a completely trustless way via coding your own solution to get KYVE data (currently on testnet) onto your own application and or database. To get started, a list of REST endpoints can be found<a href=\"https://docs.kyve.network/developers/grpc.html#api-endpoint\"> here</a>.</p><p>Since KYVE stores data onto specialized providers and not natively on its own chain, developers must fetch the underlying data directly from the storage provider. The KYVE REST-API holds the proof that data on a storage provider is valid and can be retrieved trustless. A list of valid bundles is available at the kyve/query/v1beta1/finalized_bundles/[pool_id] path.</p><p>From this, the developer will get the storage_provider_id which points to a storage provider. In combination with the storage_id, developers can retrieve the uploaded data.</p><p>Some integrations might compress data before storing it on the storage provider. The compression_id indicates which compression method has been used.</p><p>Below displays the general workflow of this process:</p><pre>response = <br>requests.get(f”https://api.korellia.kyve.network/kyve/query/v1beta1/finalized_bundles/{pool_id_input}&quot;)<br>for bundle in response.json().get(“finalized_bundles”):<br>   storage_id = bundle.get(“storage_id”)<br><br>   # retrieve file from Arweave<br>   response_from_arweave = <br>requests.get(f”https://arweave.net/{storage_id}&quot;)<br>   decompressed = gzip.decompress(response_from_arweave.content)<br>   decompressed_as_json = json.loads(decompressed)</pre><p>After the data has been retrieved from the storage provider and decompressed, developers can use it in their applications.</p><h3>More Solutions to Come</h3><p>KYVE’s goal is to help build a secure, scalable, and trustless data infrastructure for all; therefore, our team is always looking for new ways to ease the data use and access experience. With new data risks and KYVE use cases popping up each day, KYVE is just getting started introducing new solutions to best benefit from its decentralized data lake.

His SECRET is, when asked pointed questions, he switches to market-plumbing speak, hiding behind lingo.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Let me help you understand SBF's moves.</p>\n  <p>:thread: :point_down:</p>\n  <p>\\</p>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Anytime you hear or read \"Alameda,\" replace with, \"Sam's personal account.\"</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  When Alameda borrows FTX customer money, that means \"Sam borrows customer money\": Alameda is 100% owned by Sam &amp; a few friends. Alameda had no clients. \"Alameda's capital\" is Sam's, Caroline's, etc.</p>\n  <p>:point_down:</p>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>Sam says he poorly \"risk-managed\" the FTX and Alameda relationship.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  Recall: Alameda=Sam. What transpired?</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Had Liquidity Issues</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX</p>\n  <p>\\\n  • The Collateral Was Pretend Money</p>\n  <p>\\\n  3) Alameda (Sam) Had Issues:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Nobody has nailed down what happened: was Alameda *always* a fraud or did it suffer losses at some point and then get desperate (perhaps the Terra Luna implosion in the spring)?</p>\n  <p>\\\n  This is a question begging for an answer. I don't know, but…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true\">https://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4)…Sam claims he was no longer closely involved in Alameda (again, Alameda = Sam's personal capital). Sam claims Caroline &amp; Team ran it independently (other than its venture investments).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  This claim gives Sam cover to state he doesn't know the details about Alameda's issues.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  5) Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  At some point - time uncertain - Alameda (Sam) needed access to liquidity. It almost certainly had margin loans from 3rd parties being called (3rd parties like Gemini or Binance…maybe FTX?). To repay these, Alameda needed liquidity.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  6) To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  FTX client assets were the liquidity that Alameda (Sam) needed to repay its other loans. To pretend this was OK, FTX needed to hold collateral from Alameda as security against the loan (in case Alameda (Sam) didn't repay).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  7) When you borrow cash on margin, you generally have to post MORE collateral than you borrow.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Ex: you might borrow against your Schwab account. Schwab holds your account's assets as protection against you defaulting on the loan. This lets you turn investments into liquidity.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  8) Elon's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> margin loan is a prominent example:</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of TSLA stock he posts (giving him cash to do anything, like buy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TWTR&src=cashtag_click\">$TWTR</a>, without selling TSLA).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  After borrowing from the facility, if TSLA stock falls below a certain threshold (say $1 to $3)…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  9)…Elon needs to either add more collateral to the margin facility (post more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a>) or pay down the loan.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  If he does neither, the lender can liquidate the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> it holds as collateral and repay the loan from the proceeds.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Now back to Alameda (Sam)…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  10) Together, FTX &amp; Alameda (Sam &amp; Sam) developed a few shitcoins…err \"tokens\": the most relevant are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a>.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  Both FTX &amp; Alameda received huge grants of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a> (I'm just going to use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> going forward).</p>\n  <p>\\\n  F&amp;A (Sam) controlled the VAST majority of the issuance…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  11)…and only a tiny portion of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a> traded. Alameda was the largest trader. If you own 95% of something and then manipulate the price of the other 5%, you can make your 95% look REALLY valuable - just keep the price of that 5% up and look how valuable your 95% becomes!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://tenor.com/va2h.gif?embedable=true\">https://tenor.com/va2h.gif?embedable=true</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"12\">\n  <li>Guess what Alameda (Sam) used as collateral for those margin loans we were talking about? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SRM&src=cashtag_click\">$SRM</a>.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\\\n  And it doesn't appear that FTX required a big haircut on those. Remember that Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click\">$TSLA</a> stock he posts? That's an 80% haircut. But…</p>\n  <p>\\\n  13)…it doesn't appear FTX required a substantial haircut on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTT&src=cashtag_click\">$FTT</a> that Alameda (Sam) posted. Ultimately, using these shitcoins…I mean tokens, as collateral, Alameda (Sam) \"borrowed\" $9-$10 billion from FTX. That money was, almost by definition, FTX customer money.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  14) You might recall that Sam famously described tokens like these to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart\">@TheStalwart</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tracyalloway\">@tracyalloway</a> as \"magic money in a box.\" It was recognized immediately as Sam describing a Ponzi.

His SECRET is, when asked pointed questions, he switches to market-plumbing speak, hiding behind lingo.\n\\\n  Let me help you understand SBF's moves.\n:thread: :point_down:\n\\\n  \nAnytime you hear or read \"Alameda,\" replace with, \"Sam's personal account.\"\n\\\n  When Alameda borrows FTX customer money, that means \"Sam borrows customer money\": Alameda is 100% owned by Sam & a few friends. Alameda had no clients. \"Alameda's capital\" is Sam's, Caroline's, etc.\n:point_down:\nSam says he poorly \"risk-managed\" the FTX and Alameda relationship.\n\\\n  Recall: Alameda=Sam. What transpired?\n\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Had Liquidity Issues\n\\\n  • Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX\n\\\n  • To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX\n\\\n  • The Collateral Was Pretend Money\n\\\n  3) Alameda (Sam) Had Issues:\n\\\n  Nobody has nailed down what happened: was Alameda *always* a fraud or did it suffer losses at some point and then get desperate (perhaps the Terra Luna implosion in the spring)?\n\\\n  This is a question begging for an answer. I don't know, but…\nhttps://tenor.com/bhNAA.gif?embedable=true\n4)…Sam claims he was no longer closely involved in Alameda (again, Alameda = Sam's personal capital). Sam claims Caroline & Team ran it independently (other than its venture investments).\n\\\n  This claim gives Sam cover to state he doesn't know the details about Alameda's issues.\n\\\n  5) Alameda (Sam) Organized a Loan from FTX:\n\\\n  At some point - time uncertain - Alameda (Sam) needed access to liquidity. It almost certainly had margin loans from 3rd parties being called (3rd parties like Gemini or Binance…maybe FTX?). To repay these, Alameda needed liquidity.\n\\\n  6) To Paper the Loan, Alameda Posted Collateral to FTX:\n\\\n  FTX client assets were the liquidity that Alameda (Sam) needed to repay its other loans. To pretend this was OK, FTX needed to hold collateral from Alameda as security against the loan (in case Alameda (Sam) didn't repay).\n\\\n  7) When you borrow cash on margin, you generally have to post MORE collateral than you borrow.\n\\\n  Ex: you might borrow against your Schwab account. Schwab holds your account's assets as protection against you defaulting on the loan. This lets you turn investments into liquidity.\n\\\n  8) Elon's $TSLA margin loan is a prominent example:\n\\\n  Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of TSLA stock he posts (giving him cash to do anything, like buy $TWTR, without selling TSLA).\n\\\n  After borrowing from the facility, if TSLA stock falls below a certain threshold (say $1 to $3)…\n\\\n  9)…Elon needs to either add more collateral to the margin facility (post more $TSLA) or pay down the loan.\n\\\n  If he does neither, the lender can liquidate the $TSLA it holds as collateral and repay the loan from the proceeds.\n\\\n  Now back to Alameda (Sam)…\n\\\n  10) Together, FTX & Alameda (Sam & Sam) developed a few shitcoins…err \"tokens\": the most relevant are $FTT and $SRM.\n\\\n  Both FTX & Alameda received huge grants of $FTT and $SRM (I'm just going to use $FTT going forward).\n\\\n  F&A (Sam) controlled the VAST majority of the issuance…\n\\\n  11)…and only a tiny portion of $FTT / $SRM traded. Alameda was the largest trader. If you own 95% of something and then manipulate the price of the other 5%, you can make your 95% look REALLY valuable - just keep the price of that 5% up and look how valuable your 95% becomes!\nhttps://tenor.com/va2h.gif?embedable=true\nGuess what Alameda (Sam) used as collateral for those margin loans we were talking about? $FTT and $SRM.\n\\\n  And it doesn't appear that FTX required a big haircut on those. Remember that Elon can borrow $1 for every $5 of $TSLA stock he posts? That's an 80% haircut. But…\n\\\n  13)…it doesn't appear FTX required a substantial haircut on the $FTT that Alameda (Sam) posted. Ultimately, using these shitcoins…I mean tokens, as collateral, Alameda (Sam) \"borrowed\" $9-$10 billion from FTX. That money was, almost by definition, FTX customer money.\n\\\n  14) You might recall that Sam famously described tokens like these to @TheStalwart and @tracyalloway as \"magic money in a box.\" It was recognized immediately as Sam describing a Ponzi. But most of us didn't realize *Sam* was issuing these magic tokens.\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=KZYqL79GDXU&t=1292s\n\\\n\n  \nSam may argue this is just how banks (and brokerages) work: they take deposits, they lend them out based on credit judgments to earn a spread, and - as long as depositors don't ask for deposits back en masse - all is perfectly fine.\n\\\n  But let me tell you what banks don't do:\n\\\n  16) Banks do not:\n\\\n  • Lend 70% of their deposits to one borrower\n\\\n  • Have that borrower be the founder of the bank\n\\\n  • Accept made-up \"tokens\" as collateral - the actual worst collateral ever conceived • Have almost all that collateral be just two (made up) assets\n\\\n  17)\n\\\n  • Apply de minimis haircuts to collateral\n\\\n  • Accept derivatives of the bank itself as collateral! $FTT is not random - it relates to FTX\n\\\n  As @matt_levine said, Goldman Sachs should not take $GS equity as collateral - it is circular risk. And definitely not pretend-GS equity.\n\\\n  18) This Collateral Was Pretend Money\n\\\n  Alameda (Sam) & FTX (also Sam) invented intrinsically worthless tokens, keeping almost all of it for themselves.

I am not an attorney, but these issues need to be addressed–at least within the culture that surrounds the use of these models, if not the legal system itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copyright protects outputs of creative processes, not inputs. You can copyright a work you produced, whether that’s a computer program, a literary work, music, or an image. There is a concept of “fair use” that’s most applicable to text, but still applicable in other domains. The problem with fair use is that it is never precisely defined. The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20fair%20use%20doctrine,news%20reporting%2C%20and%20scholarly%20reports.\" target=\"_blank\">US Copyright Office’s statement about fair use</a> is a model for vagueness:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Under the fair use doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is permissible to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and scholarly reports. There are no legal rules permitting the use of a specific number of words, a certain number of musical notes, or percentage of a work. Whether a particular use qualifies as fair use depends on all the circumstances.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We are left with a web of conventions and traditions. You can’t quote another work in its entirety without permission. For a long time, it was considered acceptable to quote up to 400 words without permission, though that number was never codified into law, and has been going down recently–and counting words applies poorly to software as well as works that aren’t written text. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20fair%20use%20doctrine,news%20reporting%2C%20and%20scholarly%20reports.\" target=\"_blank\">Elsewhere</a> the US copyright office states that fair use includes ”transformative” use, though “transformative” has never been defined precisely. It also states that copyright does not extend to ideas or facts, only to particular expressions of those facts–but we have to ask where the “idea” ends and where the “expression” begins. Interpretation of these principles will have to come from the courts, and the body of US case law on software copyright is surprisingly small–only 13 cases, according to the copyright office’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html\" target=\"_blank\">search engine</a>. Although the body of case law for music and other art forms is larger, it’s even less clear how these ideas apply. Just as quoting a poem in its entirety is a copyright violation, you can’t reproduce images in their entirety without permission. But how much of a song or a painting can you reproduce? Counting words isn’t just ill-defined, it is useless for works that aren’t made of words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These rules of thumb are clearly about outputs, rather than inputs: again, the ideas that go into an article aren’t protected, just the words. That’s where generative models present problems. Under some circumstances, output from Copilot may contain, verbatim, lines from copyrighted code. The legal system has tools to handle this case, even if those tools are imprecise. Microsoft is currently being <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/software/369456/github-copilot-sued-over-software-piracy-on-unprecendented-scale\" target=\"_blank\">sued for “software piracy”</a> because of GitHub. The case is based on outputs: code generated by Copilot that reproduces code in its training set, but that doesn’t carry license notices or attribution. It’s about Copilot’s compliance with the license attached to the original software. However, that lawsuit doesn’t address the more important question. Copilot itself is a commercial product that is built a body of training data, even though it is completely different from that data. It’s clearly “transformative.” In any AI application, the training data is at least as important to the final product as the algorithms, if not more important. Should the rights of the authors of the training data be taken into account when a model is built from their work, even if the model never reproduces their work verbatim? Copyright does not adequately address the inputs to the algorithm at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can ask similar questions about works of art. Andy Baio has a great <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://waxy.org/2022/11/invasive-diffusion-how-one-unwilling-illustrator-found-herself-turned-into-an-ai-model/\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> of an artist, Hollie Mengert, whose work was used to train a specialized version of Stable Diffusion. This model enables anyone to produce Mengert-like artworks from a textual prompt. They’re not actual reproductions; and they’re not as good as her genuine artworks–but arguably “good enough” for most purposes. (If you ask Stable Diffusion to generate “Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci,” you get something that clearly looks like Mona Lisa, but that would embarrass poor Leonardo.) However, users of a model can produce dozens, or hundreds, of works in the time Mengert takes to make one. We certainly have to ask what it does to the value of Mengert’s art. Does copyright law protect “in the style of”? I don’t think anyone knows. Legal arguments over whether works generated by the model are “transformative” would be expensive, possibly endless, and likely pointless. (One hallmark of law in the US is that cases are almost always decided by people who aren’t experts. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" target=\"_blank\">The Grotesque Legacy of Music as Property</a> shows how this applies to music.) And copyright law doesn’t protect the inputs to a creative process, whether that creative process is human or cybernetic. Should it? As humans, we are always learning from the work of others; “standing on the shoulders of giants” is a quote with a history that goes well before Isaac Newton used it. Are machines also allowed to stand on the shoulders of giants?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-973x1048.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14807\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-973x1048.png 973w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-279x300.png 279w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-768x827.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01.png 977w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px\" /><figcaption><br>Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci. DaVinci isn’t worried. (Courtesy Hugo Bowne-Anderson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To think about this, we need an understanding of what copyright does culturally. It’s a double-edged sword. I’ve written several times about how <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/01/on-pirates-and-piracy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Beethoven and Bach made use of popular tunes in their music</a>, in ways that certainly wouldn’t be legal under current copyright law. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" target=\"_blank\">Jazz</a> is full of artists quoting, copying, and expanding on each other. So is classical music–we’ve just learned to ignore that part of the tradition. Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart could easily have been sued for their appropriation of popular music (for that matter, they could have sued each other, and been sued by many of their “legitimate” contemporaries)–but that process of appropriating and moving beyond is a crucial part of how art works. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14811\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02.png 868w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02-300x261.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02-768x667.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" /><figcaption><br>J. S. Bach’s 371Choral Copyright Violations. He would have been in trouble if copyright as we now understand it had existed.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have to recognize the protection that copyright gives to artists. We lost most of Elizabethan theater because there was no copyright.&nbsp;Plays were the property of the theater companies (and playwrights were often members of those companies), but that property wasn’t protected; there was nothing to prevent another company from performing your play.&nbsp; Consequently, playwrights had no interest in publishing their plays. The scripts were, literally, trade secrets. We’ve probably lost at least one play by Shakespeare (there’s evidence he wrote a play called Love’s Labors Won); we’ve lost all but one of the plays of Thomas Kyd; and there are other playwrights known through playbills, reviews, and other references for whom there are no surviving works. Christopher Marlowe’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Faustus_(play)\" target=\"_blank\">Doctor Faustus</a>, the most important pre-Shakespearian play, is known to us through two editions, both published after Marlowe’s death, and one of those editions is roughly a third longer than the other. What did Marlowe actually write? We’ll never know. Without some kind of protection, authors had no interest in publishing at all, let alone publishing accurate texts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there’s a finely tuned balance to copyright, which we almost certainly haven’t achieved in practice. It needs to protect creativity without destroying the ability to learn from and modify earlier works. Free and open source software couldn’t exist without the protection of copyright–though without that protection, open source might not be needed. Patents were intended to play a similar role: to encourage the spread of information by guaranteeing that inventors could profit from their invention, limiting the need for “trade secrets.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copying works of art has always been (and still is) a part of an artist’s education. Authors write and rewrite each other’s works constantly; whole careers have been made tracing the interactions between John Milton and William Blake. Whether we’re talking about prose or painting, generative AI devalues traditional artistic technique (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/on-technique/\" target=\"_blank\">as I’ve argued</a>), though possibly giving rise to a different kind of technique: the technique of writing prompts that tell the machine what to create. That’s a task that is neither simple nor uncreative. To take Mona Lisa and go a step further than Da Vinci–or to go beyond facile imitations of Hollie Mengert–requires an understanding of what this new medium can do, and how to control it. Part of Google’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://bdtechtalks.com/2022/11/07/google-generative-ai-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">AI strategy</a> appears to be building tools that help artists to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://wordcraft-writers-workshop.appspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">collaborate</a> with AI systems; their goal is&nbsp; to enable authors to create works that are transformative, that do more than simply reproducing a style or piecing together sentences. This kind of work certainly raises questions of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/people/mike-loukides/\" target=\"_blank\">reproducibility</a>: given the output of an AI system, can that output be recreated or modified in predictable ways? And it might cause us to realize that the old cliche “A picture is worth a thousand words” significantly underestimates the number of words it takes to describe a picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we best protect creative freedom?&nbsp;Is a work of art something that can be “owned,” and what does that mean in an age when digital works can be reproduced perfectly, at will? We need to protect both the original artists, like Hollie Mengert, and those who use their original work as a springboard to go beyond. Our current copyright system does that poorly, if at all. (And the existence of patent trolls demonstrates that patent law hasn’t done much better.)&nbsp; What was originally intended to protect artists has turned into a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" target=\"_blank\">rent-seeking game in which artists who can afford lawyers monetize the creativity of artists who can’t</a>. Copyright needs to protect the input side of any generative system: it needs to govern the use of intellectual property as training data for machines. But copyright also needs to protect the people who are being genuinely creative with those machines: not just making more works “in the style of,” but treating AI as a new artistic medium. The finely tuned balance that copyright needs to maintain has just become more difficult. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be solutions outside of the copyright system. Shutterstock, which previously announced that they were removing all AI-generated images from their catalog, has announced a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2343953-shutterstock-will-sell-ai-generated-art-and-compensate-human-artists/\" target=\"_blank\">collaboration with OpenAI</a> that allow the creation of images using a model that has only been trained on images licensed to Shutterstock. Creators of the images used for training will receive a royalty based on images created by the model. Shutterstock hasn’t released any details about the compensation plan, and it’s easy to suspect that the actual payments will be similar to the royalties musicians get from streaming services: microcents per use. But their approach could work with the right compensation plan. Deviant Art has released <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.dreamup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DreamUp</a>, a model based on Stable Diffusion that allows artists to specify whether models can be trained on their content, along with identifying all of its outputs as computer generated. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/adobe-stock-begins-selling-ai-generated-artwork/\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> has just announced their own set of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/stock/contributor/help/generative-ai-content.html\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a> for submitting generative art to their Adobe Stock collection, which requiring that AI-generated art be labeled as such, and that the (human) creators have obtained all the licenses that might be required for the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These solutions could be taken a step further. What if the models were trained on licenses, in addition to the original works themselves? It is easy to imagine an AI system that has been trained on the (many) Open Source and Creative Commons licenses. A user could specify what license terms were acceptable, and the system would generate appropriate output–including licenses and attributions, and taking care of compensation where necessary.

I am not an attorney, but these issues need to be addressed–at least within the culture that surrounds the use of these models, if not the legal system itself.\nCopyright protects outputs of creative processes, not inputs. You can copyright a work you produced, whether that’s a computer program, a literary work, music, or an image. There is a concept of “fair use” that’s most applicable to text, but still applicable in other domains. The problem with fair use is that it is never precisely defined. The US Copyright Office’s statement about fair use is a model for vagueness:\nUnder the fair use doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is permissible to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and scholarly reports. There are no legal rules permitting the use of a specific number of words, a certain number of musical notes, or percentage of a work. Whether a particular use qualifies as fair use depends on all the circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nWe are left with a web of conventions and traditions. You can’t quote another work in its entirety without permission. For a long time, it was considered acceptable to quote up to 400 words without permission, though that number was never codified into law, and has been going down recently–and counting words applies poorly to software as well as works that aren’t written text. Elsewhere the US copyright office states that fair use includes ”transformative” use, though “transformative” has never been defined precisely. It also states that copyright does not extend to ideas or facts, only to particular expressions of those facts–but we have to ask where the “idea” ends and where the “expression” begins. Interpretation of these principles will have to come from the courts, and the body of US case law on software copyright is surprisingly small–only 13 cases, according to the copyright office’s search engine. Although the body of case law for music and other art forms is larger, it’s even less clear how these ideas apply. Just as quoting a poem in its entirety is a copyright violation, you can’t reproduce images in their entirety without permission. But how much of a song or a painting can you reproduce? Counting words isn’t just ill-defined, it is useless for works that aren’t made of words.\nThese rules of thumb are clearly about outputs, rather than inputs: again, the ideas that go into an article aren’t protected, just the words. That’s where generative models present problems. Under some circumstances, output from Copilot may contain, verbatim, lines from copyrighted code. The legal system has tools to handle this case, even if those tools are imprecise. Microsoft is currently being sued for “software piracy” because of GitHub. The case is based on outputs: code generated by Copilot that reproduces code in its training set, but that doesn’t carry license notices or attribution. It’s about Copilot’s compliance with the license attached to the original software. However, that lawsuit doesn’t address the more important question. Copilot itself is a commercial product that is built a body of training data, even though it is completely different from that data. It’s clearly “transformative.” In any AI application, the training data is at least as important to the final product as the algorithms, if not more important. Should the rights of the authors of the training data be taken into account when a model is built from their work, even if the model never reproduces their work verbatim? Copyright does not adequately address the inputs to the algorithm at all.\nWe can ask similar questions about works of art. Andy Baio has a great discussion of an artist, Hollie Mengert, whose work was used to train a specialized version of Stable Diffusion. This model enables anyone to produce Mengert-like artworks from a textual prompt. They’re not actual reproductions; and they’re not as good as her genuine artworks–but arguably “good enough” for most purposes. (If you ask Stable Diffusion to generate “Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci,” you get something that clearly looks like Mona Lisa, but that would embarrass poor Leonardo.) However, users of a model can produce dozens, or hundreds, of works in the time Mengert takes to make one. We certainly have to ask what it does to the value of Mengert’s art. Does copyright law protect “in the style of”? I don’t think anyone knows. Legal arguments over whether works generated by the model are “transformative” would be expensive, possibly endless, and likely pointless. (One hallmark of law in the US is that cases are almost always decided by people who aren’t experts. The Grotesque Legacy of Music as Property shows how this applies to music.) And copyright law doesn’t protect the inputs to a creative process, whether that creative process is human or cybernetic. Should it? As humans, we are always learning from the work of others; “standing on the shoulders of giants” is a quote with a history that goes well before Isaac Newton used it. Are machines also allowed to stand on the shoulders of giants?\n\nMona Lisa in the style of DaVinci. DaVinci isn’t worried. (Courtesy Hugo Bowne-Anderson)\n\n\n\nTo think about this, we need an understanding of what copyright does culturally. It’s a double-edged sword. I’ve written several times about how Beethoven and Bach made use of popular tunes in their music, in ways that certainly wouldn’t be legal under current copyright law. Jazz is full of artists quoting, copying, and expanding on each other. So is classical music–we’ve just learned to ignore that part of the tradition. Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart could easily have been sued for their appropriation of popular music (for that matter, they could have sued each other, and been sued by many of their “legitimate” contemporaries)–but that process of appropriating and moving beyond is a crucial part of how art works. \n\nJ. S. Bach’s 371Choral Copyright Violations. He would have been in trouble if copyright as we now understand it had existed.\n\n\n\nWe also have to recognize the protection that copyright gives to artists. We lost most of Elizabethan theater because there was no copyright. Plays were the property of the theater companies (and playwrights were often members of those companies), but that property wasn’t protected; there was nothing to prevent another company from performing your play.  Consequently, playwrights had no interest in publishing their plays. The scripts were, literally, trade secrets. We’ve probably lost at least one play by Shakespeare (there’s evidence he wrote a play called Love’s Labors Won); we’ve lost all but one of the plays of Thomas Kyd; and there are other playwrights known through playbills, reviews, and other references for whom there are no surviving works. Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus, the most important pre-Shakespearian play, is known to us through two editions, both published after Marlowe’s death, and one of those editions is roughly a third longer than the other. What did Marlowe actually write? We’ll never know. Without some kind of protection, authors had no interest in publishing at all, let alone publishing accurate texts.\nSo there’s a finely tuned balance to copyright, which we almost certainly haven’t achieved in practice. It needs to protect creativity without destroying the ability to learn from and modify earlier works. Free and open source software couldn’t exist without the protection of copyright–though without that protection, open source might not be needed. Patents were intended to play a similar role: to encourage the spread of information by guaranteeing that inventors could profit from their invention, limiting the need for “trade secrets.”\nCopying works of art has always been (and still is) a part of an artist’s education. Authors write and rewrite each other’s works constantly; whole careers have been made tracing the interactions between John Milton and William Blake. Whether we’re talking about prose or painting, generative AI devalues traditional artistic technique (as I’ve argued), though possibly giving rise to a different kind of technique: the technique of writing prompts that tell the machine what to create. That’s a task that is neither simple nor uncreative. To take Mona Lisa and go a step further than Da Vinci–or to go beyond facile imitations of Hollie Mengert–requires an understanding of what this new medium can do, and how to control it. Part of Google’s AI strategy appears to be building tools that help artists to collaborate with AI systems; their goal is  to enable authors to create works that are transformative, that do more than simply reproducing a style or piecing together sentences. This kind of work certainly raises questions of reproducibility: given the output of an AI system, can that output be recreated or modified in predictable ways? And it might cause us to realize that the old cliche “A picture is worth a thousand words” significantly underestimates the number of words it takes to describe a picture.\nHow do we best protect creative freedom? Is a work of art something that can be “owned,” and what does that mean in an age when digital works can be reproduced perfectly, at will? We need to protect both the original artists, like Hollie Mengert, and those who use their original work as a springboard to go beyond. Our current copyright system does that poorly, if at all. (And the existence of patent trolls demonstrates that patent law hasn’t done much better.)  What was originally intended to protect artists has turned into a rent-seeking game in which artists who can afford lawyers monetize the creativity of artists who can’t. Copyright needs to protect the input side of any generative system: it needs to govern the use of intellectual property as training data for machines. But copyright also needs to protect the people who are being genuinely creative with those machines: not just making more works “in the style of,” but treating AI as a new artistic medium. The finely tuned balance that copyright needs to maintain has just become more difficult. \nThere may be solutions outside of the copyright system. Shutterstock, which previously announced that they were removing all AI-generated images from their catalog, has announced a collaboration with OpenAI that allow the creation of images using a model that has only been trained on images licensed to Shutterstock. Creators of the images used for training will receive a royalty based on images created by the model. Shutterstock hasn’t released any details about the compensation plan, and it’s easy to suspect that the actual payments will be similar to the royalties musicians get from streaming services: microcents per use. But their approach could work with the right compensation plan. Deviant Art has released DreamUp, a model based on Stable Diffusion that allows artists to specify whether models can be trained on their content, along with identifying all of its outputs as computer generated. Adobe has just announced their own set of guidelines for submitting generative art to their Adobe Stock collection, which requiring that AI-generated art be labeled as such, and that the (human) creators have obtained all the licenses that might be required for the work.\nThese solutions could be taken a step further. What if the models were trained on licenses, in addition to the original works themselves? It is easy to imagine an AI system that has been trained on the (many) Open Source and Creative Commons licenses. A user could specify what license terms were acceptable, and the system would generate appropriate output–including licenses and attributions, and taking care of compensation where necessary. We need to remember that few of the current generative AI tools that now exist can be used “for free.” They generate income, and that income can be used to compensate creators.\nUltimately we need both solutions: fixing copyright law to accommodate works used to train AI systems, and developing AI systems that respect the rights of the people who made the works on which their models were trained. One can’t happen without the other.","dc:creator":"Mike Loukides","comments":"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-does-copyright-say-about-generative-models/#respond","content":"The current generation of flashy AI applications, ranging from GitHub Copilot to Stable Diffusion, raise fundamental issues with copyright law.

While symbolic execution is a powerful technique that can augment the vulnerability discovery process, it requires some base domain knowledge and thus has its own learning curve. Given the plethora of ways in which a user can interact with such an engine and the need for frequent context switching between a disassembler and one’s terminal or script editor, integrating symbolic execution into one’s workflow can be daunting for a beginner.</p>\n<p>One of the ways Trail of Bits has sought to ease this process is by making graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Manticore that are embedded in popular interactive disassemblers. Last summer, former intern Alan Chang worked on the first such interface, <a href=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/11/17/mui-visualizing-symbolic-execution-with-manticore-and-binary-ninja/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Manticore User Interface (MUI) plugin for Binary Ninja</a>. We found that pairing Manticore directly with an interactive disassembler provides vulnerability researchers with a more convenient way to actually use (and benefit from) symbolic execution. Therefore, during my winter and summer internships at Trail of Bits, my goal was to help grow the MUI ecosystem by making a MUI plugin for Ghidra and building infrastructure to make these plugins easier to use, maintain, and develop.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103448\" style=\"width: 791px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103448\" data-attachment-id=\"103448\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/manitcore_chart/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=781%2C321&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"781,321\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Manitcore_chart\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?fit=690%2C284&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-103448\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=690%2C284&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?w=781&amp;ssl=1 781w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Manitcore_chart.png?resize=768%2C316&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103448\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.</p></div>\n<h2>The Ghidra Plugin</h2>\n<p>We figured that the most direct way to encourage more people to use MUI plugins would be to simply develop MUI plugins for a greater variety of disassemblers! Thus, I spent my winternship developing a Ghidra version of the MUI plugin; I chose Ghidra chiefly because it is popular and, unlike the commercial tool Binary Ninja, free and open source. Additionally, a few internal projects at Trail of Bits were already using Ghidra, so I would have ample opportunity to explore Ghidra plugin development. Finally, by developing a Ghidra plugin (one written in Java instead of Python), we could develop a solution that wouldn’t be tied to a single programming language, gaining insight that could guide the development of future plugins.</p>\n<p>This initial Ghidra plugin mimicked the existing Binary Ninja plugin as closely as possible. While it took a bit of time to become familiar with Java Swing and Ghidra’s widgets, simply mimicking the existing visual components and user interface was a fairly trivial task once I got going.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103450\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103450\" data-attachment-id=\"103450\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4-06-25-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=1240%2C416&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1240,416\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 4.06.25 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;A side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=300%2C101&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?fit=690%2C232&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=690%2C232&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=1024%2C344&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=300%2C101&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=768%2C258&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?resize=1200%2C403&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-at-4.06.25-PM.png?w=1240&amp;ssl=1 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.</p></div>\n<p>However, because the Ghidra plugin would be written in Java, it could not depend on the Manticore Python package or directly call Manticore’s Python API. Our solution to that challenge was to use a tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/linkedin/shiv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shiv</a> to seamlessly bundle the Manticore library and all of its dependencies into a <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0441/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python zipapp</a>. That way, we could create a “batteries-included” Manticore binary and then translate the Binary Ninja plugin’s interactions with the Manticore API into the appropriate command-line arguments. We then placed this binary in the relevant platform-specific subdirectories of Ghidra’s <code>os</code> directory, which facilitates cross-platform support.</p>\n<p>By the end of the winternship, I was able to add extra features to the Ghidra plugin, such as the ability to specify arbitrary Manticore arguments in addition to those with dedicated input fields and support for multiple Manticore instances in the same Ghidra session. This, however, brought to light an additional problem.</p>\n<h2>Feature parity and cross-disassembler development</h2>\n<p>It quickly became apparent that our approach to plugin development would not be sustainable if we aspired to expand the MUI project to support even more disassemblers. For each new MUI feature, we would first have to determine how to implement the feature, accounting for the way that the plugin interacts with Manticore (e.g., through direct calls to the Manticore API or through Manticore’s command-line interface options). Furthermore, certain front-end information shared across plugins (e.g., fixed description strings or sensible default options) would have to be repeated and standardized in each implementation.</p>\n<p>To address this problem, over the summer I developed a centralized remote procedure call (RPC) server binary for MUI. This server handles all interactions with the full-featured Manticore Python API and handles MUI functionality through individual RPCs defined in a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protocol buffer</a>. We chose to use <a href=\"https://grpc.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gRPC</a> as our RPC framework because of its performance, wide adoption, and strong support for code generation across many programming languages. As a result, MUI plugins of the future can easily contain and depend on their own gRPC-generated code.</p>\n<p>The server is written in Python, providing it access to the full functionality of Manticore’s Python API, but is bundled into a shiv binary that can be called in any language. This facilitates a new client-server architecture that allows developers to implement any back-end Manticore functionality and tests just once. Developers of the front-end disassembler plugins can make RPC requests to the server with just a few lines of trivial code, which means that their work on individual plugins can focus almost entirely on front-end/UI changes.</p>\n<p>To alleviate the “chore” of handling fixed strings and other front-end information that will be identical across plugins, we can store such data in JSON files that are packaged with MUI plugin releases and loaded on startup. In this way, we can standardize data such as the fields, field descriptors, and default values of the run dialogs used to start Manticore’s execution.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103454\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103454\" data-attachment-id=\"103454\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/fixed_data/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=1600%2C1159&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1159\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fixed_data\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Fixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?fit=690%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103454\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=690%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1024%2C742&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=768%2C556&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1536%2C1113&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?resize=1200%2C869&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fixed_data.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.</p></div>\n<h2>Demo: Developing a Feature for MUI</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the process of developing a feature for MUI. Suppose that we want to enable manual state management during the runtime of a Manticore instance. Specifically, we want the ability to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pause</strong> a state and <strong>resume</strong> it at a later time, which will be useful if we implement capabilities like execution tracing in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Kill</strong> a state at our discretion. That way, if a state bypasses an <code>avoid</code> hook or becomes stuck in an infinite loop, we will be able to abandon it.First, we will define a new RPC and the RPC’s message formats in our protocol buffer file. The server will receive the state’s numeric ID, the Manticore instance that we’re working with, and a <code>StateAction</code> enum indicating whether it should resume, pause, or kill the state.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_103456\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103456\" data-attachment-id=\"103456\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/rpc_details/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=1534%2C1124&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1534,1124\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"RPC_details\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Details of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?fit=690%2C505&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103456\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=690%2C505&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=1024%2C750&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=768%2C563&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?resize=1200%2C879&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?w=1534&amp;ssl=1 1534w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RPC_details.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103456\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Details of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.</p></div>\n<p>We’ll also need to update an existing message—<code>ManticoreStateList</code>.

In our plugins, we encapsulate all such “connector” functions in a single file. In the Ghidra plugin, writing a connector function involves only three steps. First, we create a <code>StreamObserver</code> object to asynchronously handle RPC responses. In this case, we need only implement behavior for handling error cases, since the “results” of successful <code>ControlState</code> RPCs will be available to the user via the <code>GetStateList</code> RPC. Then we build the <code>ControlStateRequest</code> object, populating the fields as required. Lastly, we actually execute the RPC through a method exposed by the gRPC-generated <code>ManticoreServerStub</code>, which conveniently handles all communication with the server for us.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_103468\" style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103468\" data-attachment-id=\"103468\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/12/13/manticore-gui-plugin-binary-ninja-ghidra/connector_method/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=1600%2C1474&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1474\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"connector_method\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?fit=690%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-103468\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=690%2C635&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"635\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1024%2C943&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=768%2C708&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1536%2C1415&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?resize=1200%2C1106&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connector_method.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-103468\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.</p></div>\n<p>The only thing left to do is to make the appropriate UI changes!

While symbolic execution is a powerful technique that can augment the vulnerability discovery process, it requires some base domain knowledge and thus has its own learning curve. Given the plethora of ways in which a user can interact with such an engine and the need for frequent context switching between a disassembler and one’s terminal or script editor, integrating symbolic execution into one’s workflow can be daunting for a beginner.\nOne of the ways Trail of Bits has sought to ease this process is by making graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Manticore that are embedded in popular interactive disassemblers. Last summer, former intern Alan Chang worked on the first such interface, the Manticore User Interface (MUI) plugin for Binary Ninja. We found that pairing Manticore directly with an interactive disassembler provides vulnerability researchers with a more convenient way to actually use (and benefit from) symbolic execution. Therefore, during my winter and summer internships at Trail of Bits, my goal was to help grow the MUI ecosystem by making a MUI plugin for Ghidra and building infrastructure to make these plugins easier to use, maintain, and develop.\n\nThe gRPC server–based architecture that MUI plugins use.\n\nThe Ghidra Plugin\nWe figured that the most direct way to encourage more people to use MUI plugins would be to simply develop MUI plugins for a greater variety of disassemblers! Thus, I spent my winternship developing a Ghidra version of the MUI plugin; I chose Ghidra chiefly because it is popular and, unlike the commercial tool Binary Ninja, free and open source. Additionally, a few internal projects at Trail of Bits were already using Ghidra, so I would have ample opportunity to explore Ghidra plugin development. Finally, by developing a Ghidra plugin (one written in Java instead of Python), we could develop a solution that wouldn’t be tied to a single programming language, gaining insight that could guide the development of future plugins.\nThis initial Ghidra plugin mimicked the existing Binary Ninja plugin as closely as possible. While it took a bit of time to become familiar with Java Swing and Ghidra’s widgets, simply mimicking the existing visual components and user interface was a fairly trivial task once I got going.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the run dialogs of Binary Ninja and Ghidra.\n\nHowever, because the Ghidra plugin would be written in Java, it could not depend on the Manticore Python package or directly call Manticore’s Python API. Our solution to that challenge was to use a tool called shiv to seamlessly bundle the Manticore library and all of its dependencies into a Python zipapp. That way, we could create a “batteries-included” Manticore binary and then translate the Binary Ninja plugin’s interactions with the Manticore API into the appropriate command-line arguments. We then placed this binary in the relevant platform-specific subdirectories of Ghidra’s os directory, which facilitates cross-platform support.\nBy the end of the winternship, I was able to add extra features to the Ghidra plugin, such as the ability to specify arbitrary Manticore arguments in addition to those with dedicated input fields and support for multiple Manticore instances in the same Ghidra session. This, however, brought to light an additional problem.\nFeature parity and cross-disassembler development\nIt quickly became apparent that our approach to plugin development would not be sustainable if we aspired to expand the MUI project to support even more disassemblers. For each new MUI feature, we would first have to determine how to implement the feature, accounting for the way that the plugin interacts with Manticore (e.g., through direct calls to the Manticore API or through Manticore’s command-line interface options). Furthermore, certain front-end information shared across plugins (e.g., fixed description strings or sensible default options) would have to be repeated and standardized in each implementation.\nTo address this problem, over the summer I developed a centralized remote procedure call (RPC) server binary for MUI. This server handles all interactions with the full-featured Manticore Python API and handles MUI functionality through individual RPCs defined in a protocol buffer. We chose to use gRPC as our RPC framework because of its performance, wide adoption, and strong support for code generation across many programming languages. As a result, MUI plugins of the future can easily contain and depend on their own gRPC-generated code.\nThe server is written in Python, providing it access to the full functionality of Manticore’s Python API, but is bundled into a shiv binary that can be called in any language. This facilitates a new client-server architecture that allows developers to implement any back-end Manticore functionality and tests just once. Developers of the front-end disassembler plugins can make RPC requests to the server with just a few lines of trivial code, which means that their work on individual plugins can focus almost entirely on front-end/UI changes.\nTo alleviate the “chore” of handling fixed strings and other front-end information that will be identical across plugins, we can store such data in JSON files that are packaged with MUI plugin releases and loaded on startup. In this way, we can standardize data such as the fields, field descriptors, and default values of the run dialogs used to start Manticore’s execution.\n\nFixed data can be stored in plugin-agnostic JSON files.\n\nDemo: Developing a Feature for MUI\nLet’s take a look at the process of developing a feature for MUI. Suppose that we want to enable manual state management during the runtime of a Manticore instance. Specifically, we want the ability to do the following:\nPause a state and resume it at a later time, which will be useful if we implement capabilities like execution tracing in the future.\nKill a state at our discretion. That way, if a state bypasses an avoid hook or becomes stuck in an infinite loop, we will be able to abandon it.First, we will define a new RPC and the RPC’s message formats in our protocol buffer file. The server will receive the state’s numeric ID, the Manticore instance that we’re working with, and a StateAction enum indicating whether it should resume, pause, or kill the state.\n\nDetails of the new RPC and its message formats are defined in the protocol buffer.\n\nWe’ll also need to update an existing message—ManticoreStateList. MUI plugins have state lists that display all states and the status of each state; these lists are updated via a GetStateList RPC. Because it’d be beneficial for users to see “paused” states as distinct from preexisting state statuses, we’ll add a new paused_states field to the RPC’s response message, which will contain a list of the states paused by the user.\n\nThe existing ManticoreStateList message is updated with a new paused_states attribute.\n\nWith that, we can proceed to generate the Python service interface code and mypy type stubs! During my summer internship, I used the command runner just to abstract away this work for developers, so we can run the just generate command to…just generate the required code!\nNow we can move on to implementing the back-end functionality. This code is contained in a single Servicer class in which each method represents an individual RPC.\nWe’ll begin by validating the RPC request data. While gRPC-generated code can check that the fields provided to it are correctly typed, it cannot enforce the use of any fields or verify that fields are well formed. Thus, we’ll write our own checks to assert the validity of the request; we’ll also set an error code and error details to be returned to the requester if the request is invalid.\n\nCode added to the back-end server validates the incoming RPC request.\n\nFinally, we can implement the state-pausing and state-killing functionality by directly accessing Manticore’s Python API. This direct access provides us far more control than we’d have if we were interacting with Manticore through its command-line options, enabling us to create a dummy busy state or abandon a specific state, for example. If all goes well, the front-end plugin will receive an empty response, which will be populated with the default OK status code.\n\nOnce the state has been successfully processed, an empty response object is returned.\n\nOne additional benefit of our approach is that we can write tests for our RPCs without having to deal with spawning up a server and connecting to it. Instead, we can simply call the Servicer’s methods directly and pass in a new Context object, which we can later inspect for error codes.\n\nWriting tests is as simple as directly calling the Servicer’s methods.\n\nOnce we’re done, we can use our trusty command runner to “just build” the shiv binary, which will give us a fresh server binary that we can use in our plugins.\nFirst, we need to generate the Java service interface code, which will be based on the updated protocol buffer. gRPC maintains a Java library, grpc-java, that will handle this for us.\nThen, we have to write the function that actually executes the RPC. In our plugins, we encapsulate all such “connector” functions in a single file. In the Ghidra plugin, writing a connector function involves only three steps. First, we create a StreamObserver object to asynchronously handle RPC responses. In this case, we need only implement behavior for handling error cases, since the “results” of successful ControlState RPCs will be available to the user via the GetStateList RPC. Then we build the ControlStateRequest object, populating the fields as required. Lastly, we actually execute the RPC through a method exposed by the gRPC-generated ManticoreServerStub, which conveniently handles all communication with the server for us.\n\nThe new “connector” method, written in Java, handles communication with the server.\n\nThe only thing left to do is to make the appropriate UI changes! For this feature, we can simply open a context menu by right-clicking on a state in the state list and then populate the state with the actions that call the controlState method!\n\nThe added code creates a new option in the context menu and calls the “connector” method when that new option is selected.\n\n\nWith the Manticore functionality handled by the gRPC server, the UI changes that we must implement on the “front ends” of the Ghidra and Binary Ninja plugins are fairly straightforward.\n\nThe “hypothetical” state management feature discussed in the demo has actually been implemented and is now part of MUI! If you’re interested in seeing all of the changes and commits, check out the pull requests for the server and the Ghidra plugin. ( These pull requests were made before a refactor of where this code lives. The code now lives in the main Manticore repository under the server directory.)\nA Quick Step-by-Step Guide\nTo summarize, the steps for adding a new feature to MUI are as follows:\nStart by modifying the MUI Server binary.\nEdit the protocol buffer (the ManticoreServer.proto file) if new RPCs or modifications to existing messages are required.\nGenerate service interface code for the server script by running the just generate command.\nAdd the functionality and the request validation code to the server script (manticore_server.py), through which one can interact with the Manticore API directly.\nWhere applicable, write tests for the new functionality.\nBuild the shiv server executable by running the just build command.\nThen, for each front-end plugin:\nUse / copy over the new server binary;\nGenerate service interface code in the programming language used by the plugin; and\nMake any relevant front-end changes (and, where applicable, share standardized data as part of MUI’s common resources).\nConclusion\nMy internships at Trail of Bits have been really fulfilling, and I’m proud of how the MUI project has progressed.

Hash rate had grown throughout the summer as publicly-traded Bitcoin miners continued to add capacity via mining rigs pre-ordered during the bull market.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"731\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:731,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfeb6d-b7ad-445f-bf94-c7c9fdca8a54_1200x731.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em><a href=\"https://charts.coinmetrics.io/formulas/#5041\">Source: Coin Metrics Network Data Pro</a></em></p><p>There&#8217;s a potentially interesting explanation behind the late September and October rise in hash rate: <a href=\"https://coinmetrics.io/special-insights/ethereum-merge/\">The Ethereum Merge</a>.

These \"one-hop\" addresses are typically controlled by individual miners contributing hash power to their mining pool of choice. Active miner addresses tend to peak just after Bitcoin price has topped, with slow-moving hardware deployments arriving late to the party as speculative enthusiasm begins to dwindle. Five months after the BTC price peaked in December 2017, monthly active miner addresses tipped 80,000, only to crash to lows near 10,000 in 2020.</p><p>This bull cycle, we didn't see nearly the same level of mining mania reflected in active addresses, potentially due to the consolidation of hash power into a smaller set of publicly-traded entities. However, in 2022 we've still seen the number of active mining addresses fall more than 50% from recent highs, reaching the lowest levels since 2011. Miner active addresses appeared to find a bottom in August, bouncing weakly back over the past few months, but activity could easily decline in December as major miners continue to file for bankruptcy.</p><p>Though the mining industry has matured significantly in the past few years, the continued trend of cyclical capitulation indicates the sector has some progress to make on proper risk management. While power-purchasing agreements enable miners to control exposure to rising energy prices, options for managing exposure to hashprice&#8212; a metric measuring USD-denominated revenue per unit of hashrate&#8212; are slim to none. To this end, mining service providers like Luxor Technologies have developed derivatives products for more sophisticated operations, allowing miners to hedge their exposure by selling hashprice <a href=\"https://hashrateindex.com/blog/luxor-technologies-launches-otc-bitcoin-mining-derivative/\">Non-Deliverable Forward</a> (NDF) contracts.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"704\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2380e3f4-421a-4345-8927-2ee0096e5191_1600x774.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" y1=\"3\" x2=\"14\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" y1=\"21\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em><a href=\"https://luxor.tech/derivatives\">Source: Luxor Technologies</a></em></p><p>In the example scenario pictured above, a miner could use Luxor's NDF contract to hedge against a month-over-month decline in hashprice. Normally, a drop in hashprice would simply result in a loss of revenue&#8212; however, if a miner sold 1,500 NDF contracts at $90 per PH/s/day, they'd effectively lock-in revenue at this threshold. Thirty days later, the miner settles the contract at a hashprice of $70 per PH/s/day, netting a $30K profit and offsetting a broader decline in mining revenue.</p><p>While Luxor's hashprice marketplace is still in its early stages, hashrate derivatives will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in managing miner risk, especially as the industry continues to attract capital allocators from more traditional sectors.</p><h3>Foundry Hammers the Competition</h3><p>With the collapse of Poolin and the unprecedented growth of the U.S. mining industry, Foundry USA Pool has aggressively expanded its share of the Bitcoin hashrate. While <a href=\"https://coinmetrics.substack.com/i/75132155/poolin-goes-off-the-deep-end\">the Poolin episode</a> serves as a healthy reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the mining pool ecosystem, the migration of hashrate has furthered the dominance of the top 3 mining pools, with Foundry, AntPool, and F2Pool collectively controlling well over 50% of market share. Foundry&#8217;s place in the top 3 is especially noteworthy, with the American mining pool overtaking the longstanding leadership of Asia-based pools at the beginning of 2022.</p><div

href=\"https://coinmetrics.io/atlas/\">Source: Coin Metrics ATLAS</a></em></p><p>Foundry&#8217;s lack of empty blocks serves as a testament to the pool&#8217;s block templating prowess. In the split seconds after a block is mined, mining pools scramble to assemble a new block template, selecting the highest-paying transactions for inclusion in their next attempt at solving the Proof-of-Work. During this short period, pools continue to throw off hashrate, meaning there&#8217;s a small chance of a block being mined before a transaction-bearing template is fully assembled.</p><p>So far in 2022, Foundry has constructed block templates quickly enough to beat the clock. With the <a href=\"https://braiins.com/stratum-v2\">upcoming release</a> of Stratum V2, however, individual miners will soon have the option of assembling their own templates, cutting mining pool-middlemen out of the transaction selection process. Whether this will affect the frequency of empty blocks&#8212; and how that will impact the mining pool landscape&#8212; still remains to be seen.</p><h3>Waves in the Mempool</h3><p>Through the latter half of 2022, the mempool has remained relatively muted, with the exception of a prolonged period of congestion in mid-November.

To catch up on our other quarterly mining reviews from this year, check out the links below.\nSOTN’s 2022 Quarterly Mining Specials: Q1, Q2, Q3 \nBitcoin hash rate continued to push higher throughout most of Q4 in spite of a subdued spot BTC price. Hash rate — a proxy for the total amount of computational effort securing the network — hit as high as 250 EH/s (quintillion hashes per second) in late October, an all-time high. Hash rate had grown throughout the summer as publicly-traded Bitcoin miners continued to add capacity via mining rigs pre-ordered during the bull market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics Network Data Pro\nThere’s a potentially interesting explanation behind the late September and October rise in hash rate: The Ethereum Merge. As independent crypto researcher Data Always has suggested, the end of Ethereum mining likely incentivized operators to repurpose industrial rack space, swapping out GPUs used to mine Ethereum with ASICs used to mine Bitcoin. It’s hard to put an exact figure on the magnitude of this resource reallocation, but Bitcoin hash rate grew quickly from 220 EH/s to 250 EH/s shortly after the completion of The Merge in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: “The Merge and crypto's electricity consumption” by Data Always\nHowever, with the price of spot BTC facing renewed downward pressure in the wake of FTX’s failures, hash rate has started to slide. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty — a network parameter that automatically adjusts every 2 weeks to keep block times in check — decreased by more than 7% recently (see first chart above), the biggest decrease since miners abruptly exited China in spring 2021. \nThe stagnation in hash rate is a sign that miners are facing a new round of challenges amid wary market conditions.\nSigns of Miner Capitulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Coin Metrics ATLAS & Reference Rates \nOne proxy we can use to monitor mining activity is the number of Bitcoin addresses receiving payouts directly from mining pools. These \"one-hop\" addresses are typically controlled by individual miners contributing hash power to their mining pool of choice. Active miner addresses tend to peak just after Bitcoin price has topped, with slow-moving hardware deployments arriving late to the party as speculative enthusiasm begins to dwindle. Five months after the BTC price peaked in December 2017, monthly active miner addresses tipped 80,000, only to crash to lows near 10,000 in 2020.\nThis bull cycle, we didn't see nearly the same level of mining mania reflected in active addresses, potentially due to the consolidation of hash power into a smaller set of publicly-traded entities. However, in 2022 we've still seen the number of active mining addresses fall more than 50% from recent highs, reaching the lowest levels since 2011. Miner active addresses appeared to find a bottom in August, bouncing weakly back over the past few months, but activity could easily decline in December as major miners continue to file for bankruptcy.\nThough the mining industry has matured significantly in the past few years, the continued trend of cyclical capitulation indicates the sector has some progress to make on proper risk management. While power-purchasing agreements enable miners to control exposure to rising energy prices, options for managing exposure to hashprice— a metric measuring USD-denominated revenue per unit of hashrate— are slim to none. To this end, mining service providers like Luxor Technologies have developed derivatives products for more sophisticated operations, allowing miners to hedge their exposure by selling hashprice Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Luxor Technologies\nIn the example scenario pictured above, a miner could use Luxor's NDF contract to hedge against a month-over-month decline in hashprice. Normally, a drop in hashprice would simply result in a loss of revenue— however, if a miner sold 1,500 NDF contracts at $90 per PH/s/day, they'd effectively lock-in revenue at this threshold. Thirty days later, the miner settles the contract at a hashprice of $70 per PH/s/day, netting a $30K profit and offsetting a broader decline in mining revenue.\nWhile Luxor's hashprice marketplace is still in its early stages, hashrate derivatives will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in managing miner risk, especially as the industry continues to attract capital allocators from more traditional sectors.\nFoundry Hammers the Competition\nWith the collapse of Poolin and the unprecedented growth of the U.S. mining industry, Foundry USA Pool has aggressively expanded its share of the Bitcoin hashrate. While the Poolin episode serves as a healthy reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the mining pool ecosystem, the migration of hashrate has furthered the dominance of the top 3 mining pools, with Foundry, AntPool, and F2Pool collectively controlling well over 50% of market share. Foundry’s place in the top 3 is especially noteworthy, with the American mining pool overtaking the longstanding leadership of Asia-based pools at the beginning of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics ATLAS\nInterestingly, Foundry has also managed to maintain its foothold as the dominant mining pool without mining a single empty block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics ATLAS\nFoundry’s lack of empty blocks serves as a testament to the pool’s block templating prowess. In the split seconds after a block is mined, mining pools scramble to assemble a new block template, selecting the highest-paying transactions for inclusion in their next attempt at solving the Proof-of-Work. During this short period, pools continue to throw off hashrate, meaning there’s a small chance of a block being mined before a transaction-bearing template is fully assembled.\nSo far in 2022, Foundry has constructed block templates quickly enough to beat the clock. With the upcoming release of Stratum V2, however, individual miners will soon have the option of assembling their own templates, cutting mining pool-middlemen out of the transaction selection process. Whether this will affect the frequency of empty blocks— and how that will impact the mining pool landscape— still remains to be seen.\nWaves in the Mempool\nThrough the latter half of 2022, the mempool has remained relatively muted, with the exception of a prolonged period of congestion in mid-November. A massive flood of 12-15 sat/vB transactions (allegedly due to a Binance cold wallet consolidation) resulted in a substantial spike in the average mining reward, with F2Pool netting over 0.73 BTC in transaction fees for a single block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Coin Metrics FARUM\nOf course, it wouldn't be a Bitcoin bear market without a bit of vicious community in-fighting about seemingly minor technical details. Casual users of Bitcoin likely haven’t even heard of Replace-by-Fee (RBF), a unique transaction type that allows users the option to re-broadcast a prior on-chain payment with a slightly higher fee.\nReplace-by-Fee was designed to help relieve mempool pressure in periods of congestion, allowing users to bump transactions up the priority queue in exchange for a slightly higher tip to miners. However, members of Bitcoin’s business community warn the feature is easy to abuse— users can also “reverse” 0-confirmation transactions by re-broadcasting a payment and substituting their own address as the recipient. For merchants unsuspectingly accepting malicious 0-conf transactions, this effectively amounts to a double-spend, increasing the risk of chargeback fraud.\nSince their introduction in 2016, RBF-enabled transactions have become increasingly common. However, with the controversial release of Bitcoin Core 24.0, Replace-by-Fee is now the default setting for node mempools. While this change has seen plenty of pushback from the merchant community, developers stand firmly behind the upgrade, arguing that 0-confirmations have never been safe to accept in the first place. If you want instant settlement, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is a better option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: txstats.coinmetrics.io\nIn any case, miners have little direct incentive to worry about the potential for Replace-by-Fee fraud. Higher fees simply boost miner’s bottom line, no matter where they come from. Nonetheless, the increased complexity of monitoring RBF transactions could also make block templating significantly more difficult, forcing miners to keep their finger on the pulse of the mempool more than ever before.\nBetter Hashing Days Ahead?\nMiners have had a tough year and a particularly hard Q4. Looking to 2023, there are plenty of outstanding questions that will dictate the direction of the Bitcoin mining industry beyond just the price of BTC. \nWith the expansion of the industry’s US footprint, mining is being analyzed differently by various jurisdictions. In November, New York enacted a first of its kind two-year moratorium on new mining operations in the state. Meanwhile, as Texas prepares for winter, the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) recently reported 1.7 gigawatts (GW) worth of Large Flexible Loads primarily composed of Bitcoin miners to help state grid operators manage periods of high demand. The interactions between miners and governments at the local, state, and possibly federal level could continue to accelerate in 2023. \nOn the operational side, miners will likely need to continue to monitor input costs in the face of higher industrial electricity rates. Large operators with competitive rates in advantageous locations optimizing over every variable are poised to succeed in this environment. Further maturation and technical upgrades next year could benefit the ecosystem, such as the impending launch of Stratum V2.\nThere are plenty of challenges, but in the face of it all miners continue to hash away, securing the chain while cleverly positioning operations for success and survival.\nCoin Metrics Updates\nThis week’s updates from the Coin Metrics team:\n\nJoin us on The Mining Pod on December 21st, where we’ll provide a recap of Bitcoin mining data in 2022.\n\nWe're excited to be growing our data and research-focused community on gm.xyz, come join the conversation!\n\nCheck out our market-data focused newsletter State of the Market, featuring weekly updates on market conditions and news across the crypto ecosystem.\n\nAs always, if you have any feedback or requests please let us know here.\nSubscribe and Past Issues\nCoin Metrics’ State of the Network, is an unbiased, weekly view of the crypto market informed by our own network (on-chain) and market data.\nIf you'd like to get State of the Network in your inbox, please subscribe here.

They were great for our business and even better for our understanding. Of course we expect every feature to boost usage, but we couldn’t have anticipated the growth yielded by those two features. And the correlation was easy to analyze: both features directly implement a vision of the P2P economy.</p><p>The P2P economy refers to disintermediated exchange, like creative people trading the fruits of their creativity — podcasts, videos, fanfic novels, 3D-printed cosplay accessories — with users for cash, without the intervention of banks, payment processors, or aggregators.</p><p>Each intermediary in an interaction induces friction and increases the distance from the desired experience, and they can’t help it. Banks have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Aggregation platforms have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Payment processors have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit.</p><p>Notice the pattern? While each intermediary claims to be giving users what they want, they’re actually serving different groups who want different things at the same time. That intermediaries always take a cut, induce friction, and increase the distance between people and experiences isn’t the result of bad management or evil intentions, it’s just the nature of the beast.</p><p>So why not create something far better for users? Let people interact directly, pay each other directly, exchange goods and services directly. There are even services out there — social networks, messaging services, content aggregators, gaming platforms — that would like to facilitate exchanges among their users, but they can’t because legacy intermediaries induce too much (financial, regulatory, UX) friction. Worse still, the centralization induced by these large data networks increases their power over each user and, therefore, increases the risk of abuse to all users.</p><p>The P2P economy isn’t some billionaire’s pipe dream; it describes a world where we’re closer to the experiences we value and to each other.

While both of those functions are in the Breez app, they feel like their own little self-contained interfaces, tailor-made for their respective purposes (or as close as we could get with the technological limitations of running a node on a phone).</p><p>But you can only cram so many activities and experiences into a <a href=\"https://medium.com/breez-technology/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-lightning-wallet-dc9ac46d32\">non-custodial Lightning payment app</a>. And however clever, charming, and good looking a team behind the payment app may be, they’re not necessarily best placed to devise new ways of applying P2P payments to new types of experience. We know how to make Lightning mobile and how to improve its UX, but when it comes to commerce, music, video streaming, or any other vertical solution, experts in those fields know better how to craft the best experience.</p><p>Indeed, the POS mode and the podcast player are just scratching the surface of what’s possible. We implemented them according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\">the KISS principle</a>. Though they have scaled remarkably and attracted thousands of new users, they’re basically demo versions implemented to showcase how people interface with the P2P economy.</p><p>Could others with fine-grained expertise of those and other kinds of experience come up with better ways to apply P2P money to P2P interaction? <em>Of course they could</em>. And would those better applications achieve scale that our neophyte, outsider attempts never could? <em>Absolutely</em>.</p><p>And that’s the point. The better we apply the tech, the closer people get to the experiences they want, the more they will use the tech, the faster Lightning will scale. The scale we’re aiming for is not X orders of magnitude; we’re shooting for a world where kids roll their eyes whenever an adult says “Back in the fiat days…”</p><p>Achieving scale is a matter of reducing friction, and multiple, tailor-made apps that apply Lightning technology optimally to life’s many worthwhile pursuits is the best way of minimizing friction and expanding the P2P economy. It’s not about making the best wallet that can do everything; it’s about adapting Lightning — the means — to whatever ends users want and whatever kind of experience they want in exchange.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*VAZ6woKIBYlUtlWA\" /><figcaption>(Image: <a href=\"https://singularityhub.com/2016/04/05/how-to-think-exponentially-and-better-predict-the-future/\">Alison E. Berman</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>LaaS Liberates Lightning</h3><p>Those who understand the technical requirements of running a non-custodial Lightning app will have realized already that adapting Lightning payments to any number of existing and yet-unimagined applications is incompatible with running a node in a single app. Lightning is far too technically demanding to scale the P2P economy as we have described it. Running the kind of always-on node required is an experience that few users, developers, creators, or vendors out there will relish.</p><p>We’re envisioning, inventing, and realizing <strong>Lightning as a Service </strong>(LaaS). LaaS is about using Lightning to remove friction from life, from the experiences we crave. The point isn’t to improve the user experience <em>in the app</em>, but to improve the users’ experience <em>of Lightning as a whole</em> that gives them more value in their lives.</p><p>And LaaS is doable. As Breez envisions it, LaaS has three major components, the first of which is in development, the second has an alpha set to launch in a couple of months, and the third exists already and just needs to scale:</p><h4>A Lightning SDK</h4><p>As it stands, anyone seeking to integrate Lightning payments to their existing business faces a steep learning curve. Accepting payments over Lightning requires them to run a node, secure liquidity with an LSP, manage fiat exchanges, perform swaps on and off the Bitcoin blockchain, manage a wallet, and so on. A non-custodial SDK would give P2P entrepreneurs and existing web utilities access to those functions without having to start from scratch.</p><p>With a well-designed SDK, developers will be able to select the Lightning functions they need from a menu and integrate them quickly and easily into their own applications. Instead of having to learn the Lightning tech stack, a Lightning SDK will let developers simply plug it into their own tech stacks.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-Sgz6UfiUL-LHU1s\" /></figure><h4>Hybrid architecture</h4><p>Lightning needs to be immediately available wherever and whenever people want to make payments. Locking a user’s functionality into a single app or on a single device would require the user to adapt to the technology, which is backwards. That’s friction.</p><p>At the same time, though, KYC friction and global, cross-market expansion requires a peer-to-peer, non-custodial solution. As soon as LSPs start acting like banks, regulators will start treating them like banks. That’s friction too.</p><p>The solution is a hybrid architecture based on <a href=\"https://medium.com/breez-technology/get-ready-for-a-fresh-breez-multiple-apps-one-node-optimal-ux-519c4daf2536\">sovereign remote nodes</a>, but that locates those nodes in the cloud rather than on users’ local devices. To deliver both optimal user sovereignty with a next-gen UX, we’ve partnered with Blockstream and their <a href=\"https://blog.blockstream.com/en-greenlight-by-blockstream-lightning-made-easy/\">Greenlight product</a>. Any service can access these nodes from any device, but as long as the users’ keys are locally stored, users maintain custody of their own funds, minimizing the operators’ regulatory profile.</p><p>P2P + minimal friction = scale.</p><h4>Decentralizing liquidity</h4><p>There is no credit on Lightning. The liquidity to settle any transaction needs to be preloaded onto the network. While this imposes a significant liquidity burden on those seeking to process users’ payments, it also presents the rich opportunity of a snowball effect: the more liquidity the network contains, the more transactions it can process, the more transaction fees the operators can collect, the more liquidity they have to invest in the network, and so on.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.lynalden.com/lightning-network/\">Lyn Alden</a> recently put it,</p><blockquote>Once there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of participants, and with larger average channel balances, then routing a payment from any arbitrary point to any other arbitrary point on the network becomes exponentially easier and more reliable.</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xIHhDYxMFyFXI3iN\" /><figcaption>Ironically, snowballs are only possible when water is frozen, i.e. <em>not liquid</em>.

While he must be held accountable for his actions, the American public deserves to hear directly from the former CEO, Waters said. \nLawyers estimate up to one million FTX creditors around the world are impacted by its bankruptcy, although how many are US-based is unclear. \nWaters threatened Bankman-Fried with subpoena to front Congress  \nEarlier this month, Waters encouraged Bankman-Fried to testify before a Financial Services committee.\n“We appreciate that you’ve been candid in your discussions about what happened at FTX,” Waters tweeted. “Your willingness to talk to the public will help the company’s customers, investors and others.”\nBankman-Fried responded to Waters’ request two days later, where he said he’d testify once learning exactly what happened with FTX, but was uncertain if he’d be ready in time for the hearing.\nFollowing criticism for not outright serving Bankman-Fried a subpoena to testify, the US representative for California’s 43rd congressional district shot back, claiming one was “definitely on the table.” \nBankman-Fried later acquiesced, claiming he would appear virtually on Tuesday. “… As the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th,” he tweeted.\n\n\nLies are circulating @CNBC that I am not willing to subpoena @SBF_FTX. He has been requested to testify at the December 13th hearing. A subpoena is definitely on the table. Stay tuned.\n— Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) December 8, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the timing of his arrest — on the day before his supposed appearance before Congress — has industry watchers (and social media) wondering whether coincidence or coordination is to blame. \n“An arrest has always been suspected,” Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation told Blockworks in a statement. “What’s interesting is the timing — right before two Congressional hearings.”  \nThe speed at which authorities filed charges against Bankman-Fried, however, likely indicates regulators had received information from cooperating witnesses, the New York Times reported Monday citing sources familiar with the matter.\nThe SEC separately charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding FTX’s equity investors on Tuesday, of which around 80 were based in the US. Tuesday on Tuesday. They together contributed more than $1.1 billion to Bankman-Fried ventures, the SEC said, representing about 60% of all funds he’d raised.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nCan’t wait?

月 13 日，FTX 创始人SamBankman-Fried 被巴哈马警方正式逮捕。\n根据巴哈马官方的声明，美国司法部门已经正式对 SBF 提起刑事诉讼，巴哈马警方在收到美国正式通知后逮捕了 SBF，并将按照要求引渡他。美国纽约南区检察官办公室的推文也证实了这一点 ，并表示，即将公布起诉书。据纽约时报援引消息人士报道，FTX 创始人 SBF 被指控犯有电汇欺诈、电汇欺诈共谋、证券欺诈、证券欺诈共谋和洗钱罪。\n此前，SBF 频繁接受各大媒体采访，并流连于各类推特 Space，让不少人心生疑惑，为何 FTX 崩盘后， SBF 似乎安然无恙？\n尘埃逐渐落定。\n就在 SBF 被逮捕的前几天，深潮 TechFlow 通过视频采访了 SBF。那一天，SBF 似乎精神不错，久违地露出了多次笑容。在采访的过程中，他不断强调自己很懊悔，重复表示“我搞砸了”，表明自己想要“积极解决客户的问题”；但另一边，他又将矛头对准了 CZ 和负责破产清算的 FTX 现任 CEO 及团队。在他看来，CZ 是扣动扳机，最终导致 FTX 爆炸的人。\n值得一提的是，SBF 在采访中承认，过去他将很多的精力浪费在了媒体以及 FTX 的品牌建设上，没有专注于产品优化和风险管理，现在看来造成了很多问题。\n在采访的最后，我们问他，你最后悔的事情是什么？\n他表示，“后悔出事后的那段时间我不应该在媒体消失，我本可以做更多”。\n真相还是谣言？\n深潮 TechFlow：自 FTX 破产以来，三箭资本频繁发起对 Alameda 的指控， 称在 LUNA 崩溃的事件中，三箭资本是被 Alameda 集团所猎杀，最终导致了三箭资本失去了自身 LP 与债权人的全部资金，此外，《纽约时报》也报道，美国曼哈顿联邦检察官开始调查 Alameda 是否是 LUNA 崩盘的幕后黑手，你怎么回应这些指控，是 Alameda 猎杀了 LUNA 和三箭资本吗？\nSBF：绝对不是。虽然今年很多事情都搞砸了，我很懊悔，因为这些事情直接导致了 FTX 的破产，我无比难过，但并不是说所有的事情都是这个原因造成的。\n三箭资本的崩溃与我们没有关系，Terra 更和我们没有任何关系，某种程度上来说，三箭资本和 Alameda 有着类似的经历。杠杆多头头寸、市值下降、最终被清算，我为他们的经历感到同情和难过，为今年因市场下跌而受到伤害的所有人感到难过，但我不能认同他们散布谣言，试图把自己的问题归咎于他人的行为。\n我觉得他们都是聪明人，我真的难以置信，他们真的相信 Alameda 与他们的头寸有任何关系。市场崩溃了，这很直接，但这与我采取的行动没有任何关系，与 Alameda 没有任何关系，从我的角度来看，他们只是在寻找一个替罪羊，想为自己的问题找到别人来承担责任。\n深潮 TechFlow：在 FTX 事件发生过后，你不断坚称自己对 Alameda财务状况没有详细了解，导致不知情发生了资金混用的情况，但福布斯报道称，你两年整理了 5 张资产清单，对 Alameda 的财务理解精确到个位数，你如何看待报道的内容？\nSBF：我寄给福布斯的那份文件是为了回应关于我 Holdings（持股） 的问询。我发送给了他们一份 Summary（概要），有关于我的 Holding 和 Alameda 的 Holding，这给了我一部分信息，我也知道了 Alameda 的 Token Holdings 的一些信息，但我并没有完全卷入其中。\n我只是看了一下 Alameda 的那些未平仓保证金头寸，但没有涉及到所有头寸的详情，这导致我并没有对 Alameda 有任何详细的了解，包括实际的全部资产净值等，只是知道他们的一些资产是什么，直到最近出事了我才知道了全部。\n深潮 TechFlow：所以你只是知道具体的数据，但是不知道为什么？\nSBF：我只知道其中的一部分。比如我知道 Alameda 最大资产在哪，但我不知道他们的负债。我知道有哪些借款或贷款，或者他们在 FTX 上的仓位，主要的代币持有量，我期望知道更多，但是显然事实不是这样。\n深潮 Tech Flow：最近，金融时报（FT）曝光了 Alameda 和 FTX Ventures 累计接近 500 项投资的明细，总价值共计超过 50 亿美元，这些用于投资的钱来自于哪里？回头来看，里面的一些投资是否过于草率？\nSBF：进行这样的投资绝对是一个错误。虽然我认为其中许多投资本身是合理的，但 Alameda 的投资规模太大，大概最终有数十亿美元，这也是导致它长期处于多头头寸和缺乏流动性的部分原因，我绝对希望 Alameda 没有进行过规模那么大的投资。\n媒体与自我\n深潮 TechFlow：在推特上，很多人有一种不满的情绪，认为你“贿赂”了华尔街日报/彭博社等一众媒体，他们似乎淡化了 FTX 破产的危害和性质，FTX 的媒体策略是怎样的？\nSBF：媒体策略要看是出事前还是出事后。如果倒退到崩溃之前的一个月，很明显，我与媒体有很多接触。我相当积极地和媒体谈了很多，我的目标是尽可能地帮助大家，让人们了解加密货币生态系统中发生的事情，试图帮助向立法者和其他人进行宣传。\n但这其中，我的很多话成了反击我的素材。上个月 FTX 崩盘的时候，我也是这样做，我与记者交谈，说我的想法，并试图有所帮助，但是他们会认为这种崩溃与我有关。从那时起，我进入了一个不怎么与媒体交谈的时期。我很后悔这么做，因为那个时期的报道有点脱离现实。显然，我搞砸了很多事，这绝对是事实，媒体对此也有权对此进行报道，但也有很多阴谋论开始四处流传，而这些都是不真实的。而且这种说法都占据了上风，包括 Luna 和三箭资本的崩溃……这都与我无关，却在媒体报道中经常出现。\n*背景：近期，《金融时报》披露了 Alameda 的近 500 项投资组合，其中包括对多家媒体的投资。此外，知名加密媒体 The Block 披露其前任 CEO 曾秘密从 SBF 获得累计 4300 万美元贷款。\nSBF：崩盘发生时，我确实消失了一段时间。这意味着有一段时间我的声音没有被听到，当时我觉得这很合适。但现在回想起来，当时有很多疯狂的事情出现。但我知道，真相会以某种方式出现的，但是我当时应该积极回击那些不真实的东西。\n深潮 TechFlow：此前在媒体上， 你被宣传为“有效利他主义者”，如今，在大多数人看来，这只是一种人设包装，来进行伪装和欺骗。真实的 Sam 是怎样的，你有什么不变的信仰？\nSBF：我试图做对世界未来有利的事情，显然是这样。但我现在搞砸了，我知道我没有做出想象中应有的影响力。我深感遗憾，也永远无法解决这个问题，这将持久困扰我。但这是我一直在努力做的事情，也是我将继续努力做的事情。这很令人兴奋，但也确实造成了遗憾。我想做我认知中对世界有益的事情，这是不变的，虽然我做错了很多，但也是我一直努力的方向。\n深潮 Tech Flow：你是加密货币以及区块链的信徒么，还是在你看来，加密货币仅仅是你赚钱的工具？\nSBF：是的，我是一个忠实的信徒。当我第一次接触到加密货币时，它只是一个赚钱的工具。2017 年，我第一次开始交易，我不知道加密货币是什么，也不关心那么多，它只是一个我可以交易和赚钱的东西。但在我交易的第一年里，我学到了很多关于加密货币是什么的知识。我必须使用它，并在加密货币交易所间进行转移。在这个过程中，我了解了加密货币最初存在的原因。\n交易所的未来\n深潮 TechFlow：FTX 倒塌之后，Binance 的地位得到了加强，你怎么看待未来中心化交易所的发展，Binance 会一直一家独大么？\nSBF：好问题，我不确定会发生什么，但是显然 Binance 变得更强大了。在这一点上，他们拥有大部分的交易量。我与他们有分歧，对他们在 FTX 暴雷时所做的很多事情感到非常沮丧。不过，他们也建立了一个好的产品，他们的用户很喜欢使用币安，为此要给他们点赞。\n在这个市场上，有竞争是很重要的，如果垄断的话，不一定能看到真正的竞争或增长。防止垄断很重要，有多个真正有流动性的交易所也很重要，包括 Binance。希望其他机构能够继续生存和发展，但我很担心这可能会形成一定的交易所市场中心化，我不认为这对每个人来说都是一种健康发展的态势。\n深潮 TechFlow：那你怎么看待中心化交易所（CEX）和去中心化交易所（DEX）的未来？\nSBF：有些事情只能在中心化交易所完成。为了说明这一点，我们可以思考，任何真正的计算密集型的东西，都很难在 DEX 上做，因为有吞吐量和延迟的限制。即使在今天最快的去中心化网络，数以万计的交易和数亿秒的延迟，这些数字都比你能在中心化服务器上得到的差得多。因此，当你有大量的交易或者高频交易时，在中心化交易所会有优势。\n但另一方面，一个去中心化的交易所是可验证的，它有储备金证明，它到底要做什么，代码都是在链上布置。任何人都可以在它的基础上建设，并可以用它组成其他东西，这是非常强大的。因此，去中心化的交易所也有很多优势。\n我的猜测是，我们将看到一个组合，即在一些中心化的交易所中看到一些非中心化的交易所的身影，真正计算密集型的产品将倾向于在中心化的交易所中交易，而在非中心化交易所中较少。你可以在中心化交易所更快地交易，有更多的计算资源可以使用，很明显，这是有代价的。\n深潮 TechFlow：你怎么看待在事件过程中 CZ 的角色，他的行为对整个事件产生了怎样的影响？\nSBF：他在其中发挥了很大的作用。我认为，在那之前的几个月里，他有很多公关活动，准备破坏 FTX 的市场信任。最终，他引发了破产。不仅是最初他说要卖 FTT，那个周末有一大批人跟进推文，他试图尽可能带起市场情绪，而不是仅仅试图寻找一个 OTC 交易。如果卖出 FTT 是他的首要目标，他选择了一个非常漫长的过程，要花很长时间，这会使他能够一直谈论这个话题。我认为这可能是故意的。他可能是故意想让 FTX 在这个过程中失去的更多。快要崩盘的时候，他说他想要收购。我不认为他准备认真地贯彻这个 想法，也不认为他曾认真想过会收购 FTX。他只是想跟我们打一次交道，最后肯定是会反悔的。我对 CZ 在事件中扮演的角色并不满意，这是一个有针对性的行为，这不是在试图帮助这个行业变得更好，它只是想要伤害竞争对手。\n深潮 TechFlow：你认为是他触发了本次危机？\nSBF：是的，他是最终采取了导致爆炸的行动的人。当然我也有责任，FTX没有做好风险管理，这是我的错，所以他才能有可乘之机。但我确实认为是他扣动了扳机。\n深潮 TechFlow：假设没有 Coindesk 的报道和CZ抛售 FTT，你认为 FTX 会是一种怎样的结局？\nSBF：这是一个非常好的问题。我不知道会发生什么，但我认为，我们会有更多的转机。在事件早期，不同的力量从各方涌入，从而导致了崩塌。在过去的几个月里，我已经开始重新参与到业务中，认为 FTX 将变得更加强大，我们的资产负债表将变得更加强大。\n深潮 TechFlow：为什么开始重新参与业务？有什么节点吗?\nSBF：没有什么特别的。只是前一年，我在一些事情上浪费很多时间，我一直把更多的时间放在媒体上，放在我喜欢的关于 FTX 未来愿景的品牌建设上。它们确实很重要，并不是说它们与业务无关，但我还有很多更重要的事情。\n首先，我本应该专注于风险管理，专注于检修我们的匹配引擎和其他事情。而除了我搞砸了之外，没有任何解释的空间。在过去的几个月里，我基本上接受了这个事实，即我已经变得不那么踏实，我需要更多地参与业务建设，更努力地工作，并更多地关注工作的一些重要的事情，比如修补匹配引擎和其他事情。那个时候我有很多事情要做，我已经想好了怎么进行风险管理，不幸的是，崩溃比结果更早到来。\n深潮 TechFlow：Skybridge 创始人  Anthony Scaramucci 说，在前往中东募资的旅途中，你在中东投资者面前猛烈抨击了 CZ，后来这些话传到了 CZ 耳朵里，这是真的么？如果是，你现在是否感到后悔？\nSBF：我不知道。Scaramucci 肯定是听到了什么，我不知道他的想法或感受。在筹款电话中，每个人都会谈论自己的产品。我说了很多交易所的优势，谈论我们做得好的地方，以及如何从竞争中脱颖而出。募资过程中问的最多的是，什么使你与竞争对手不同？\n这就是我所说的，有时候我只是笼统地谈论了什么使我们与众不同，有时我也会具体谈论与其他特定交易所相比，我们的优势。我试图真诚地讲述我心目中他们的好与不好，而且显然 Binance 有些地方做得非常好，这导致他们成为世界上最大的交易所，这是令人难以置信的。但我也会谈一谈我觉得我们比竞争对手更好的方式，我觉得 FTX 是有很地方优于 Binance 的。对每个人来说，可能都是如此，当他们听到好话和坏话时，引起他们共鸣的，往往是负面的那部分。\n深潮 TechFlow：FTX 拿到了很多明星 VC 的投资，比如红杉资本、Paradigm 和淡马锡，你认为在当时你吸引到众多机构投资的原因是什么？有什么窍门？\nSBF：当时我们正在寻找企业合作伙伴，他们也正在建立一个白标合作伙伴的集合。他们帮我们投资来达到这个目的，建立关系，同时获得收购的资本。我不知道他们为什么投资于 FTX 和我，他们比我更清楚。但我确实认为，我们在许多方面，都可以说是非常引人注目的产品和公司，但显然我们也有很大的优化空间。\n深潮 TechFlow：从2019年开始，你一直捐赠支持民主党，成为了民主党的最大捐赠者之一，你的动机是什么？这些钱是来自于用户吗？FTX 从“亲自政治”中获得了哪些好处？\nSBF：这些捐款不是在 FTX 上进行的，那是我给肯尼迪的捐款。这对所有那些我认为重要的、我认为候选人可以帮助支持的疫情预防和其他事业都有好处。我确实花了很多时间在华盛顿特区与监管机构和政策制定者交谈，但是为了帮助建立加密货币生态系统的监管框架，然后与监管机构讨论 FTX 的许可证。主要的捐款目的还是为了防止疫情大爆发。\n未来何去何从\n深潮 TechFlow：目前，众多势力在争夺 FTX 资产的处置权，你预计，在 FTX 无法提款的用户什么时候能拿回部分属于他们的资产？\nSBF：这很混乱。很多政府已经介入了。有巴哈马、Chapter 11 Team、欧洲的监管机构、澳大利亚的监管机构、日本的监管机构……这其实非常混乱的。我希望无论最后处置权交给谁，他们会把客户放在第一位，他们会尽一切可能为客户提供更多的帮助。他们中的一些人正在这样做，很多国际监管机构和管理者一直在帮助客户，但不幸的是，看起来确实会有一场管辖权之争。\n深潮 TechFlow：据我们了解，有很多 FTX 的员工因为信任你，大部分资产也在 FTX 上，并且没有取出来，对于这部分员工，你会给予补偿么，你想对他们说什么？\nSBF：我感到非常抱歉。我愿意做任何我想做的事情为他们做出补偿，我现在没有能力这样做。我没有资金可以给他们，但我没有忘记这一点。我希望我能够对得起他们。我希望有一天，我能够使其他每一个 FTX 的客户都得到补偿。我正在为此而努力。我不能保证我一定会成，但这是我现在花费所有时间的地方。\n坦率地说，我认为它已经在发生，我对它没有开始发生感到惊讶、沮丧和愤怒。我本以为美国和日本的所有客户如今都可以得到补偿，这本应该已经发生了。我感到困惑和惊讶的是，为什么 chapter 11 team 还没有做这一点。而且，我有几十亿美元的潜在融资提议，但都没有被采纳。这两件事都很令人沮丧。我认为，如果 chapter 11 的团队想的话，他们已经可以开始将一些资产归还给客户，但这还没有发生。我将尽我所能，使客户尽可能得到补偿。在下个月或下两个月内，这方面会有进展。\n深潮 TechFlow：你收到过刑事指控吗？你是否担心入狱？\nSBF：还没有，我不知道会发生什么。显然，监管机构正在研究这个问题。不过这不是我现在所关注的，我目前专注于客户的处理问题。在某地某时，或许我需要考虑自己，但肯定不是现在。\n*注：本文采访于 SBF 被美国司法部门起诉，巴哈马警方逮捕前。\n深潮 TechFlow：对行业造成如此重大的影响，你会有负罪感么，最让你后悔的一件事是什么？\nSBF：我对所发生的事情感到难以置信的内疚和难以置信的糟糕。我并不希望发生这些事情，但如果我有更多的行动，我本可以阻止它，我应该有更多的发言权，但我没有，我真的很后悔，出事后的那段时间我不应该在媒体消失，我本可以做更多的。\n\n\nThanks for reading 深潮 TechFlow !

A lot has been said about them in public, so we will only focus on some other, slightly more technical aspects here.</p><p>Foremost, the launch day was a memorable one. First, some (unexpected, unlike Kusama) chaos was brought upon the community when <a href=\"https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/78\">the initial proposal</a> which was supposed to enable pools passed and no new pools could yet be created. The issue was quickly discovered, and luckily, thanks to both the council and technical committee being available, within half a day, a <a href=\"https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/286\">fix motion</a> was proposed, fast-tracked by the technical committee, unanimously voted aye by the community, and executed. With that, at block <a href=\"https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/12726652\">12726652</a>, the first nomination pools on Polkadot were created.</p><p>Then, an interesting competition to obtain pool id 1 was unraveled. Within the first block, 8 pools was already created, indicating that interested participants used bots and transaction tips to compete with one another.</p><p>Within the next few days, all the 64 pools that were initially designated to exist were created. As noted in the proposal description, the 64 limit is merely a temporary measure of rate control, and there is no technical reason for it to exist. Nonetheless, history has shown us that it is for the benefit of the protocol to start slow, especially with a new feature.</p><blockquote>You can learn more about the aftermath of launching pools <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P0VqiL7T_P4?t=255\">in the 9th episode of the AGG podcast</a>.</blockquote><h3 id=\"nomination-pools-whats-next\">Nomination Pools: What&apos;s Next?</h3><p>With the initial launch behind us, we should discuss the immediate next steps that could follow:</p><p><strong>Commission</strong>: Our initial assumption when designing nomination pools was to exclude commission, namely because:</p><ol><li>Running a pool has not hardware cost, unlike a validator.</li><li>Entities would have other, non-financial incentives to operate a pool.</li></ol><p>Nonetheless, from a framework perspective, we decided to add an optional commission to the <code>pallet-nomination-pools</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12511\">Substrate</a> (the underlying SDK for building Polkadot and parachains) for the sake of completeness. We will make sure that this feature remains optional, and the final decision of enabling it is left out to the Polkadot community.</p><p>Moreover, we still predict that even if setting a commission is allowed, nomination pools&apos; market will adjust around an extremely small commission, as most pool operators would run their pool with a small amount of commission.</p><p><strong>Governance</strong>: Currently, DOT (and KSM) staked in the nomination pools are not directly usable in the governance.

A lot has been said about them in public, so we will only focus on some other, slightly more technical aspects here.\nForemost, the launch day was a memorable one. First, some (unexpected, unlike Kusama) chaos was brought upon the community when the initial proposal which was supposed to enable pools passed and no new pools could yet be created. The issue was quickly discovered, and luckily, thanks to both the council and technical committee being available, within half a day, a fix motion was proposed, fast-tracked by the technical committee, unanimously voted aye by the community, and executed. With that, at block 12726652, the first nomination pools on Polkadot were created.\nThen, an interesting competition to obtain pool id 1 was unraveled. Within the first block, 8 pools was already created, indicating that interested participants used bots and transaction tips to compete with one another.\nWithin the next few days, all the 64 pools that were initially designated to exist were created. As noted in the proposal description, the 64 limit is merely a temporary measure of rate control, and there is no technical reason for it to exist. Nonetheless, history has shown us that it is for the benefit of the protocol to start slow, especially with a new feature.\nYou can learn more about the aftermath of launching pools in the 9th episode of the AGG podcast.\nNomination Pools: What's Next?\nWith the initial launch behind us, we should discuss the immediate next steps that could follow:\nCommission: Our initial assumption when designing nomination pools was to exclude commission, namely because:\n\nRunning a pool has not hardware cost, unlike a validator.\nEntities would have other, non-financial incentives to operate a pool.\n\nNonetheless, from a framework perspective, we decided to add an optional commission to the pallet-nomination-pools in Substrate (the underlying SDK for building Polkadot and parachains) for the sake of completeness. We will make sure that this feature remains optional, and the final decision of enabling it is left out to the Polkadot community.\nMoreover, we still predict that even if setting a commission is allowed, nomination pools' market will adjust around an extremely small commission, as most pool operators would run their pool with a small amount of commission.\nGovernance: Currently, DOT (and KSM) staked in the nomination pools are not directly usable in the governance. This is the next high priority item in our list, and we are currently exploring multiple ways to enable it.\nStaking In Governance\nOther than the proposals related to enablement of nomination pools, two other staking-related governance items are ongoing.\nFirst, a discussion/proposal is ongoing to double the number of nomination pools from 64 to 128. This is expected, and we highly support it. Pools are highly scalable and the community should gradually move toward using it to its utmost extent.\nNext, a proposal has been opened to tweak the existing limits on nominators. The proposal description is fairly extensive, but to summarize: The proposal argues that with the existence of nomination pools, and the fact that the threshold to be an active nominator is around 200 DOT, Polkadot should no longer accept nominator with 10 DOT (existing limit). The proposal suggest increasing this limit to 100 DOT. Also, the proposal is removing any limits on the total number of nominator, as this number has also been just a precautionary limit and is no longer needed.\nStaking Roadmap\nWith the release of nomination pools, it could be argued that Polkadot's staking is (after almost a year of intense development) at a \"stable\" position. Namely, it has reached a point of having a high degree of scalability, without compromising on the core benefits of NPoS. We are exploring future directions that can be taken as next step, and will share them with the community through the Polkadot forum within the next few months. This is the best time to share your opinions on this through any of the following mediums:\n\nMaking an issue in Substrate.\nOpening a discussion thread in the Polkadot forum.\nNomination Pools Technical Support Channel.\n\nIn the meantime, you can find a backlog of all the existing issues and enhancement in the Nominated Proof of Stake project in Substrate.\nFast-Unstake Being Tested in UIs\nFast-unstake, explained in last staking update, is being actively implemented in multiple wallets and UIs, and is already available in Westend.\nNotable Pull Requests\n\nRe-claiming pool-ids is now possible: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12407.\nPermissionless auto-compounding: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12608.\n\nThanks to @Doordaschon for their valuable contributions!\nStaking Dashboard: One Month In\nOne month has already passed since staking dashboard’s initial release. In this period the dashboard has been visited almost 30,000 times, and this has allowed us to begin battle testing and identifying bugs and shortfalls.\nWe are now analysing the dashboard and identifying areas of improvement, and you can expect revisions to the UI to be rolled out in the near future as we continue to aggregate feedback and form the dashboard’s long term roadmap.\nSome notable additions to the dashboard this month include:\n\nA revamped filtering system and filter UI that has been applied to validators and pool lists.

Synthetix Founder Kain Warwick’s initial governance vision did not include on-chain governance due to it being “<a href=\"https://blog.synthetix.io/transition-to-decentralised-governance/#:~:text=The%20second%20aspect,holders%20over%20time.\">fundamentally flawed.</a>” Warwick argued that on-chain governance created a greater project risk to Synthetix than the possibility of the Synthetix Foundation being captured by a bad actor.</p><p>In July 2020, Synthetix fully transitioned from a foundation to a DAO composed of three <span>subDAOs</span>:</p><ul><li>protocolDAO was responsible for protocol upgrades and variable configurations.</li><li>grantsDAO was responsible for funding public goods in the Synthetix ecosystem.</li><li>synthetixDAO was responsible for managing and deploying funds to contributors and other project needs.</li></ul><p></p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/89916267e794b9937e25b047a48842904d35d7c5-1600x900.png?w=800\" alt=\"\"><h2>Governance Overview</h2><p>Synthetix governance has been through multiple iterations, including the formation of liquid democracy and the <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/bdf13736-7533-4985-817f-858b814cfb51\">dilution</a> of voting power, before the V3 Governance Module (V3GM) introduction in June 2022. <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/d38f47b7-2d25-433e-830e-b5fdb35ac34f\">SIP 207: V3GM</a> outlines Synthetix’s latest governance iteration and updating its council-based <a href=\"https://messari.io/dao/synthetix-governance\">governance structure</a> to four councils and one committee.</p><p>Council-based governance is an alternative to the primary governance models of token-weighted and delegated governance. It leans more towards traditional governance models, such as representative democracy and a board of directors. By depending on fewer people with an equal voting power to make decisions, council-based governance seeks to address the shortcomings of its counterparts. Token-weighted and delegated governance often result in voter apathy and a large voting power concentration. To elect council members within the DAO, Synthetix uses a quadratic voting model.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/758dff8af714a978ecd6f84c6fc15ade9969f713-1280x720.jpg?w=800\" alt=\"\"><h2>V3GM</h2><p>With the V3GM model, all council <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/1990e975-81a3-4b9b-b10c-44c6b4b97b04\">nominations</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/dao/synthetix-governance?tab=process#:~:text=Synthetix%20Council%20Election\">elections</a> move from an off-chain process on Snapshot to the on-chain Election Module on Optimism. Among many benefits, the transition to on-chain Council elections has increased Synthetix’s decentralization by mitigating the possibility of human interference. The protocolDAO is no longer required to execute off-chain election results and manually transfer the Council NFT to the elected members. Instead, elections will now be conducted on-chain.</p><p>The key considerations Synthetix made when designing V3GM was to optimize for low-cost elections and avoid having signers for the DAO’s multi-sig where tokenholders have no recourse to remove the signers. Thus, Synthetix Core Contributors chose Optimism as a Layer-2 (L2) network to optimize for low-cost <span>gas fees</span> and an inclusive on-chain elections voting process. Since there is a large pool of Synthetix voters on Ethereum <span>Layer-1</span> (L1), V3GM has an intermediary solution that uses a Merkle tree snapshot of L1 debt holders and uploads it into the Optimism L2 instance. This intermediary solution will be replaced once the V2.X debt migration happens.</p><p>The on-chain Election Module has brought a new voting strategy to Synthetix governance:</p><ul><li>The current epoch duration for an elected council member is three months but will change to four months in <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/8510c8e4-d3e0-4ae4-8c8d-47a913e48f52\">2023</a>.</li><li>Eligible voters are debt unit tokenholders who have staked their SNX.</li><li>Nominations and elections happen concurrently during a two-week <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/1990e975-81a3-4b9b-b10c-44c6b4b97b04\">period</a>.</li><li>Voting power is calculated by the debt share balance.</li><li>One candidate per vote, applying the associated voting power of one voter to the one candidate.</li><li>Voting weight is quadratic, 1 debt unit = sqrt(1) vote, except for the treasury council, which is linear.</li><li>Vote counting is a plurality voting strategy.

SIPs implement core changes to the Synthetix Ecosystem. SCCPs modify system configuration variables. SIPs and SCCPs are only voted on by the eight elected Spartan Council members of the current epoch and must follow the specified Synthetix <a href=\"https://messari.io/dao/synthetix-governance?tab=process\">governance process</a>.</p><p></p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d2defc9ffc64cba11682ab32c8df2e5808d6a9a2-1600x900.png?w=800\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/a312968439be646a909464b9d08ff62fec39ac9c-1600x900.png?w=800\" alt=\"\"><p>In the Synthetix governance process, there are two types of proposals: governance and meta-governance. The proposal type can be found in the Synthetix Proposal Repository in the table at the top of each SIP and SCCP (i.e., <a href=\"https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-300/\">SCCP 300</a>). Governance proposals do not need all eight Spartan Council members to vote for a proposal for it to succeed. Meta-governance proposals require all eight Spartan Council members to vote on the proposal for its success. Meta-governance proposals are for any changes in how governance operates, and governance proposals are for any changes affecting protocol updates.</p><h2>Governance Impact on SNX</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b2ad7c3a32041fb24a1056f2b8d3fffd813fe756-1600x900.png?w=800\" alt=\"\"><p>Since Jan. 1, 2022, Synthetix governance has had 168 proposals, making it the third most active DAO that Messari Governor monitors. Most proposals this year have been related to revenue generation, following Warwick’s anticipation of this driving the <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/kain.eth/wstTdM5tz1LqdupcKwBCJBJ-tHNtP-CAITf-ewJqRd0#:~:text=Conclusion,yield%20farming%20wars.\">next DeFi narrative</a>.</p><h3>Staked SNX Percentage</h3><p>As discussed in an earlier <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/governor-note-synthetix-turning-off-the-money-printer?referrer=all-research\">Synthetix Governor Note</a>, multiple proposals throughout 2022 focused on incentivizing greater staked SNX by implementing unsustainable inflationary SNX rewards. The inflationary SNX rewards introduced in various proposals successfully bootstrapped and secured the network at the expense of creating constant SNX sell pressure. SNX stakers could hedge their exposure by continuously selling their newly unlocked SNX each week.</p><p><a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/b24346ce-2b47-4191-b652-8339995d29ee\">SIP 276: Turn Off The Money Printer</a> was proposed to cap the total supply of SNX at 300 million and stop the unsustainable inflationary SNX rewards. This effort would ensure that the sUSD fee yield per SNX would grow with the protocol’s revenue, since sUSD rewards are based on the trading fees accrued in the Synthetix ecosystem. However, SIP 276 has not yet moved to a Snapshot vote and is currently in limbo as the SIP 276 author (Warwick) decided not to present it publicly. In addition, the Spartan Council decided <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/dd8d1a38-de36-4210-a7b4-918ad7d36d62\">SCCP 211</a> (the proposal to reduce SNX inflation by 5% each week) would be sufficient until new Synthetix products are launched. The discussion to terminate SNX inflationary rewards may be revived once the Spartan Council assesses the impact of the new Synthetix products. </p><p>Synthetix initially planned to <a href=\"https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-monetary-policy-changes/\">terminate</a> inflationary SNX rewards in March 2023, which would leave SNX with a total supply of ~250 million. However, the <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/synthetix/historical\">SNX outstanding supply</a> is currently at ~310 million SNX at the time of writing. This effectively makes SIP 276 irrelevant, considering the 300 million SNX circulating has already been surpassed, and ~738,500<strong> </strong>inflationary SNX rewards will be distributed the week of Dec. 7, 2022. The number of rewards distributed will continue to decline by 5% each week<strong>.</strong></p><p>The four proposals that dictated the inflationary rewards were&nbsp; <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/c41af42c-d6dd-48c1-9ecc-6d99741ebf00\">SCCP 196</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/825478ee-4de1-4c16-87c4-2e40d4ce4cde\">SIP 202</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/c0e9bfe4-beb1-450c-95db-e8f542f64d69\">SCCP 208</a>, and <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/dd8d1a38-de36-4210-a7b4-918ad7d36d62\">SCCP 211</a>. The initial goal of SCCP 196 and SIP 202 were to hit a targeted staked SNX percentage of 85% to bootstrap and secure Synthetix by increasing the weekly SNX rewards to incentivize more SNX tokenholders to stake their SNX. However, these proposals did not <a href=\"https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-276/#:~:text=Recently%20several%20inflation,eliminating%20inflation%20entirely.\">meaningfully impact</a> the staked SNX percentage, and the targeted staked SNX percentage was ultimately lowered to 65%.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/34f1aa728c78ef1dd28b7d7b200239739716f423-1600x900.png?w=800\" alt=\"\"><p>If <a href=\"https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-300/\">SIP 300</a> and the other V3-related proposals (<a href=\"https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-302/\">SIP 302</a>, <a href=\"https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-308/\">SIP 308</a>, and <a href=\"https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-309/\">SIP 309</a>) are implemented, multi-collateral staking will be accepted as collateral for the Synthetix debt pool. As a result, the staked SNX percentage metric will be less important in V3. Rather than relying on one form of collateral, V3 will allow Synthetix to be more flexible accept various collateral and provide subsequent liquidity to various markets and financial instruments.</p><h3>Atomic Swaps</h3><p>The goal of <a href=\"https://blog.synthetix.io/atomic-exchanges-synthetixs-mainnet-volume/\">atomic swaps</a> is to allow decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators to conduct&nbsp;Synthetix swaps on Ethereum mainnet in an atomic manner (i.e., that they happen in one trade). For example, an atomic swap could look like this ETH &lt;&gt; sETH &lt;&gt; sUSD &lt;&gt; BTC in one swap. The benefits of atomic swaps are less slippage and lower fees.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://blog.synthetix.io/the-mirarch-release/\">Mirarch release</a> implemented <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/1df2304f-869c-4b4e-8394-d1cbdaa691f7\">SIP 198</a>’s atomic exchange functionality update and introduced latency attacks on the Synthetix protocol via atomic swaps on 1inch and Kwenta. This update led to increased Synthetix trade volume and sUSD trade fee rewards because these latency attacks were bots front-running trades to get the best prices. The results were more profitable trades and, ultimately, significant increases in Synthetix trade volume. These latency attacks only affected Synthetix on Ethereum Mainnet. Trades on Optimism are not subject to latency attacks as there is no 10-minute <a href=\"https://blog.synthetix.io/how-fee-reclamation-rebates-work/\">fee reclamation</a> period given its oracle latency.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2055c388684d98bb1b7116a56612b731c5206141-1600x900.png?w=800\" alt=\"\"><p>In response to these latency attacks, <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/1a0ea134-5967-4248-aa96-1addfa34f5a6\">SIP 267</a> was introduced to allow the Spartan Council to approve protocols (contracts or externally owned addresses) that wanted to implement atomic swaps. By implementing atomic swaps, protocols were given the ability to interact with Synthetix’s core exchange functionalities and set customized parameters. SIP 267 successfully returned trade volumes and the sUSD trading fee rewards back to healthy levels, alleviating the sell pressure on SNX.</p><p>While SIP 267 was successful, the path to success was not so smooth. <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/63112e73-daf6-417c-be72-208f4252aeb4\">SCCP 224</a> failed twice, after aiming to limit latency attacks by lowering the atomic volume per block from 5 to 0.5 million sUSD. This short-term fix was rejected by the Spartan Council, as only 4 votes were cast out of a possible 16 over the two votes, signaling SIP 267 and <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/060f4321-2b9a-4a57-a03b-2920fa1ea355\">SIP 288</a> were the preferred solutions amongst the Spartan Council.

To do this, all elected council members, including Spartan Council members, are held accountable for providing value to Synthetix.

This includes what is in the best interest of SNX, asset management, and risk management.

With the ethos of the DAO model being transparent in its communications, private communications feel like a step in the wrong direction.</p><h2>Synthetix Governance Looking Forward</h2><p>The announcement of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/synthetix_io/status/1549061444389330945?s=20&amp;t=mXo0sQ3nlqjpZuL04GzDcA\">Synthetix V3</a> created a buzz on Twitter in July 2022, sparking conversations regarding the future of the Synthetix protocol. Synthetix V3 outlines the long-term vision of permissionless asset creation, improved credit control, Liquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS), and a differentiated debt pool. At the time of writing, SIPs 300–312 are all currently in the draft phase, but these proposals aim to migrate Synthetix from V2.X to V3. The transition to V3 will likely be completed in early 2023. V3 will update many of the Synthetix smart contracts and improve Synthetix’s current technical and economic inefficiencies — thus improving the user experience across the Synthetix ecosystem.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Synthetix is one of the oldest DeFi protocols and is currently in a state of transition as it implements lessons from the DeFi sector into Synthetix V3. Synthetix’s overall focus is to survive and thrive in the long term. A clear example of this can be seen in the successful SIPs and SCCPs that balance user growth while also optimizing for increased revenue to build a sustainable protocol. </p><p>Although a few areas of Synthetix Governance could be improved, all the Synthetix Councils have been actively delivering value to the Synthetix protocol. They seem to be acting in good faith on behalf of the Synthetix community while actively trying to drive value back to the Synthetix ecosystem. The upcoming voting (and subsequent implementation) of all the Synthetix V3 SIPs (300–312) means the Synthetix Community should have a lot to look forward to in the new year.</p><h3>Appendix</h3><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/af3cdc9222a4efc64a22ea9edb41f00534d58121-1600x900.png?w=800\" alt=\"\"><p><br><em>Let us know what you loved about the report, what may be missing, or share any other feedback by</em>&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://06jiny4c1wy.typeform.com/to/DsmsVsUp?typeform-source=www.google.com#research=state-of-synthetix-governance\">filling out this short form</a>.

Synthetix Founder Kain Warwick’s initial governance vision did not include on-chain governance due to it being “fundamentally flawed.” Warwick argued that on-chain governance created a greater project risk to Synthetix than the possibility of the Synthetix Foundation being captured by a bad actor.\nIn July 2020, Synthetix fully transitioned from a foundation to a DAO composed of three subDAOs:\n\nprotocolDAO was responsible for protocol upgrades and variable configurations.\ngrantsDAO was responsible for funding public goods in the Synthetix ecosystem.\nsynthetixDAO was responsible for managing and deploying funds to contributors and other project needs.\n\n\nGovernance Overview\nSynthetix governance has been through multiple iterations, including the formation of liquid democracy and the dilution of voting power, before the V3 Governance Module (V3GM) introduction in June 2022. SIP 207: V3GM outlines Synthetix’s latest governance iteration and updating its council-based governance structure to four councils and one committee.\nCouncil-based governance is an alternative to the primary governance models of token-weighted and delegated governance. It leans more towards traditional governance models, such as representative democracy and a board of directors. By depending on fewer people with an equal voting power to make decisions, council-based governance seeks to address the shortcomings of its counterparts. Token-weighted and delegated governance often result in voter apathy and a large voting power concentration. To elect council members within the DAO, Synthetix uses a quadratic voting model.\n\nV3GM\nWith the V3GM model, all council nominations and elections move from an off-chain process on Snapshot to the on-chain Election Module on Optimism. Among many benefits, the transition to on-chain Council elections has increased Synthetix’s decentralization by mitigating the possibility of human interference. The protocolDAO is no longer required to execute off-chain election results and manually transfer the Council NFT to the elected members. Instead, elections will now be conducted on-chain.\nThe key considerations Synthetix made when designing V3GM was to optimize for low-cost elections and avoid having signers for the DAO’s multi-sig where tokenholders have no recourse to remove the signers. Thus, Synthetix Core Contributors chose Optimism as a Layer-2 (L2) network to optimize for low-cost gas fees and an inclusive on-chain elections voting process. Since there is a large pool of Synthetix voters on Ethereum Layer-1 (L1), V3GM has an intermediary solution that uses a Merkle tree snapshot of L1 debt holders and uploads it into the Optimism L2 instance. This intermediary solution will be replaced once the V2.X debt migration happens.\nThe on-chain Election Module has brought a new voting strategy to Synthetix governance:\n\nThe current epoch duration for an elected council member is three months but will change to four months in 2023.\nEligible voters are debt unit tokenholders who have staked their SNX.\nNominations and elections happen concurrently during a two-week period.\nVoting power is calculated by the debt share balance.\nOne candidate per vote, applying the associated voting power of one voter to the one candidate.\nVoting weight is quadratic, 1 debt unit = sqrt(1) vote, except for the treasury council, which is linear.\nVote counting is a plurality voting strategy. The candidates with the most voting power will be elected as equal voting members on the respective council.\nThe number of elected members:\nSpartan Council: 8\nGrants Council: 5\nAmbassador Council: 5\nTreasury Council: 4\n\n\nGovernance Process\nProposals fall into one of two categories, Synthetix Improvement Proposal (SIP) or Synthetix Configuration Change Proposal (SCCP). SIPs implement core changes to the Synthetix Ecosystem. SCCPs modify system configuration variables. SIPs and SCCPs are only voted on by the eight elected Spartan Council members of the current epoch and must follow the specified Synthetix governance process.\n\n\nIn the Synthetix governance process, there are two types of proposals: governance and meta-governance. The proposal type can be found in the Synthetix Proposal Repository in the table at the top of each SIP and SCCP (i.e., SCCP 300). Governance proposals do not need all eight Spartan Council members to vote for a proposal for it to succeed. Meta-governance proposals require all eight Spartan Council members to vote on the proposal for its success. Meta-governance proposals are for any changes in how governance operates, and governance proposals are for any changes affecting protocol updates.\nGovernance Impact on SNX\n\nSince Jan. 1, 2022, Synthetix governance has had 168 proposals, making it the third most active DAO that Messari Governor monitors. Most proposals this year have been related to revenue generation, following Warwick’s anticipation of this driving the next DeFi narrative.\nStaked SNX Percentage\nAs discussed in an earlier Synthetix Governor Note, multiple proposals throughout 2022 focused on incentivizing greater staked SNX by implementing unsustainable inflationary SNX rewards. The inflationary SNX rewards introduced in various proposals successfully bootstrapped and secured the network at the expense of creating constant SNX sell pressure. SNX stakers could hedge their exposure by continuously selling their newly unlocked SNX each week.\nSIP 276: Turn Off The Money Printer was proposed to cap the total supply of SNX at 300 million and stop the unsustainable inflationary SNX rewards. This effort would ensure that the sUSD fee yield per SNX would grow with the protocol’s revenue, since sUSD rewards are based on the trading fees accrued in the Synthetix ecosystem. However, SIP 276 has not yet moved to a Snapshot vote and is currently in limbo as the SIP 276 author (Warwick) decided not to present it publicly. In addition, the Spartan Council decided SCCP 211 (the proposal to reduce SNX inflation by 5% each week) would be sufficient until new Synthetix products are launched. The discussion to terminate SNX inflationary rewards may be revived once the Spartan Council assesses the impact of the new Synthetix products. \nSynthetix initially planned to terminate inflationary SNX rewards in March 2023, which would leave SNX with a total supply of ~250 million. However, the SNX outstanding supply is currently at ~310 million SNX at the time of writing. This effectively makes SIP 276 irrelevant, considering the 300 million SNX circulating has already been surpassed, and ~738,500 inflationary SNX rewards will be distributed the week of Dec. 7, 2022. The number of rewards distributed will continue to decline by 5% each week.\nThe four proposals that dictated the inflationary rewards were  SCCP 196, SIP 202, SCCP 208, and SCCP 211. The initial goal of SCCP 196 and SIP 202 were to hit a targeted staked SNX percentage of 85% to bootstrap and secure Synthetix by increasing the weekly SNX rewards to incentivize more SNX tokenholders to stake their SNX. However, these proposals did not meaningfully impact the staked SNX percentage, and the targeted staked SNX percentage was ultimately lowered to 65%.\n\nIf SIP 300 and the other V3-related proposals (SIP 302, SIP 308, and SIP 309) are implemented, multi-collateral staking will be accepted as collateral for the Synthetix debt pool. As a result, the staked SNX percentage metric will be less important in V3. Rather than relying on one form of collateral, V3 will allow Synthetix to be more flexible accept various collateral and provide subsequent liquidity to various markets and financial instruments.\nAtomic Swaps\nThe goal of atomic swaps is to allow decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators to conduct Synthetix swaps on Ethereum mainnet in an atomic manner (i.e., that they happen in one trade). For example, an atomic swap could look like this ETH <> sETH <> sUSD <> BTC in one swap. The benefits of atomic swaps are less slippage and lower fees.\nThe Mirarch release implemented SIP 198’s atomic exchange functionality update and introduced latency attacks on the Synthetix protocol via atomic swaps on 1inch and Kwenta. This update led to increased Synthetix trade volume and sUSD trade fee rewards because these latency attacks were bots front-running trades to get the best prices. The results were more profitable trades and, ultimately, significant increases in Synthetix trade volume. These latency attacks only affected Synthetix on Ethereum Mainnet. Trades on Optimism are not subject to latency attacks as there is no 10-minute fee reclamation period given its oracle latency.\n\nIn response to these latency attacks, SIP 267 was introduced to allow the Spartan Council to approve protocols (contracts or externally owned addresses) that wanted to implement atomic swaps. By implementing atomic swaps, protocols were given the ability to interact with Synthetix’s core exchange functionalities and set customized parameters. SIP 267 successfully returned trade volumes and the sUSD trading fee rewards back to healthy levels, alleviating the sell pressure on SNX.\nWhile SIP 267 was successful, the path to success was not so smooth. SCCP 224 failed twice, after aiming to limit latency attacks by lowering the atomic volume per block from 5 to 0.5 million sUSD. This short-term fix was rejected by the Spartan Council, as only 4 votes were cast out of a possible 16 over the two votes, signaling SIP 267 and SIP 288 were the preferred solutions amongst the Spartan Council. The approval and implementation of SIP 267 and SIP 288 (1inch Direct Integration) allow 1inch to include Curve as a path for deep liquidity and less slippage, reducing the likelihood of latency attacks.\nThe Spartan Council and Synthetix community’s desire to solve the latency attacks demonstrates the sustainable long-term thinking in Synthetix Governance. The net outcome of solving the latency attacks was an improved trading experience (via lower fees and less slippage) in the Synthetix ecosystem. This long-term thinking has also led the Spartan Council to focus on improving another Synthetix product, perpetual futures.\nPerpetual Futures\nThere are three perpetual futures proposals (SIP 279, SIP 280, and SIP 281) in the draft status that aim to upgrade synthetic perpetual futures [V1] to V2. Upgrading the perpetual futures contracts should improve the constrained scalability and efficiency due to the following limitations:\n\nCapital inefficiency — restrictive open interest limits.\nFunding rate volatility.\nHigh fees and wide spreads.\n\nThese proposals demonstrate that Synthetix aims to be a market leader of perpetual futures on Optimism. If Synthetix continues to capture more perpetual futures market share on Optimism, perpetual futures could become a valuable revenue source for Synthetix.\nCommunication\nThe Spartan Council is arguably one of the most transparent DAOs in the space. The Spartan Council members are active in the Synthetix Discord, weekly Spartan Discussions, which are published as podcasts, and SNXweave, a Synthetix grantee that provides weekly recaps of the activity from the four Synthetix Councils via blog and YouTube.\nThis level of communication is rare within the DAO governance space. Despite Synthetix’s transparency, it is easy to miss new developments and properly gather community sentiment on all proposals due the governance decisions happening on multiple platforms. Without a traditional forum platform, such as Discourse or Commonwealth, it is difficult to research Synthetix governance and to filter for specific topics.\nCommunication Recommendations\nImproving the searchability of Synthetix governance content would alleviate a major pain point for Synthetix community members and might even encourage new Synthetix users to participate in governance. There are several ways Synthetix could improve its content's searchability. \nThe recaps by SNXweave are valuable to the Synthetix community, but they sometimes lack the nuance of the detailed discussions between council members on the Spartan Discussion calls. Thus, transcribing the audio from the Spartan Discussions and posting the transcription as a blog would benefit the Synthetix community because it would allow for greater searchability of the Spartan Discussions. If this were implemented, community members could find and discover key governance information about specific proposals.\nDiscord’s major drawback is that it is difficult to search for historical topics, especially in a very active Discord like Synthetix’s. Using a forum platform like Discourse or Commonwealth to organize all the Synthetix governance-related topics would keep governance topics organized and searchable. While the repository is a good resource, it does not include the community’s feedback on the proposals. \nThe Synthetix governance documentation is outdated. This is understandable, given Synthetix governance has undergone multiple iterations over the past three years. Nevertheless, it would be very valuable to allocate resources to maintain this documentation in order to minimize confusion for current and future Synthetix community members.\nImproved searchability and updated documentation will provide a better user experience for Synthetix community members interested in governance, and it will eliminate the silos that exist today. Improving these two aspects could even increase the number of active governance participants since there will be historical context to help community members understand Synthetix properly. That said, Synthetix is not necessarily incentivized to encourage greater governance participation in Synthetix Governance from the broader Synthetix community, given that only its current council members cast votes. All things considered, when more voices participate in discussions, even if they aren’t voting, the quality of decisions and council members' accountability increase.\nAccountability Analysis\nSpartan Council\nThe Spartan Council has been entrusted by the Synthetix community to be actively involved in making decisions in Synthetix’s best interest. Currently, Synthetix is attempting to balance the protocol’s main objectives of increasing the number of active users and SNX stakers with the goal of creating a  revenue-driven, sustainable protocol in a bear market. To do this, all elected council members, including Spartan Council members, are held accountable for providing value to Synthetix. The foundation of providing value to a DAO is showing up and participating. SNXweave has collected council participation data and conducted Team 360 Self Reviews to quantitatively measure council members' level of participation over the last two epochs.  \nThe Spartan Council meeting and voting participation rates from the Spartan Council members are as follows:\n\nThe Spartan Council voting data shows that there were a total of 101 SIPs and SCCPs that went to an off-chain vote during Q2 and Q3 2022. There were also 808 possible votes that could have been cast by the eight Spartan Council members during each epoch. Of these 808 possible votes, 112 votes (13.86%) Spartan Council votes were not cast.\nThe data collected from the Team 360 Self Review questionnaires is a valuable snapshot of accountability information. This effectively represents how the Spartan Council members felt their Spartan Council peers performed and participated on their behalf throughout the epoch. The Team 360 data displays the effectiveness of each Council member, distilled down to one number. Synthetix voters can use this number to reliably assess each Council member's commitment.\nHowever, the Team 360 Self Reviews do not come without a few drawbacks, namely:\n\nThe reviews lack context as to why a council member believes another council member has inadequately participated during the epoch without further investigation.\nThe reviews open a possible attack vector, allowing council members to provide inaccurate reviews in bad faith. However, there is no evidence or accusations of this happening to date.\n\nGrants Council\nThe Grants Council’s role in the Synthetix ecosystem is to review grant applications and fund developers who are mission-aligned and willing to grow the Synthetix ecosystem. All grant applications, details, and voting history are provided on the Grants Council’s website. Since Sept. 23, 2021, only 7 of the 68 grant applications have been approved through this grant process.\nAs mentioned in the Q3 2022 Quarterly Report by SNXweave, grantees have delivered on the following:\n\nFee Rebate Initiative — providing OP tokens for referrals and covering trading fees for whale traders to boost Kwenta’s synthetic futures product.\nExplainer Synthetix videos by content creators.\nWrapper UI.\nNew SIP/SCCP submission website with a better user experience so anyone can easily submit a proposal.\nSNXweave—- attendance and participation report and weekly recaps of the Synthetix Councils.\n\nSome other projects that have received grant funding are the NFT Project, HERO stats page, and SNXweave. The HERO stats page would be a welcomed upgrade from the Synthetix community as it aims to address the accuracy issues of Grafana, Synthetix's current statistics dashboard. However, the subgraph complexities and lack of resources have deemed the HERO stats page no longer viable. The Grants Council has paused all efforts on system-wide statistics until Synthetix transitions to V3.\nThe goal of the NFT project is to raise funds for liquidity provisioning in the Synthetix ecosystem and for public goods funding to be distributed by the Grants Council. The proceeds raised by the NFT Project will be split 80% going to liquidity provisioning and 20% to public goods funding. Any secondary market royalties will be split with the same ratio.\nThe Grants Council meeting and voting participation rates from the Grants Council members are as follows:\n\nWhile the Grants Council has clear responsibilities outlined in SIP 141, there are no key performance indicators (KPIs) provided for the community to measure the success of the Grants Council (grantsDAO). To further transparency and accountability, Grants Council members could propose SIPs with clearly listed Grants Council KPIs, which would enable the Synthetix community to objectively measure the success of the grant funding.\nAmbassador Council\nUnlike SIP 39 (to set up grantsDAO) or SIP 141 (to formalize the responsibilities and role of the grantsDAO), SIP 241 (KPI-based Ambassador Mandate) provides a clear mandate and KPIs for the Ambassador Council. This mandate and KPIs set a good example of clarity for other councils to follow. All of the information needed to evaluate the success of the Ambassador Council is included in the proposal. The Ambassador Council’s KPIs to measure performance are quoted below:\n\nTotal delegated voting power of all ecosystem governance tokens.\nThe number of social events and their audience/viewership count (Town Halls, DAO 2 DAO community calls, Twitter spaces).\nSum of protocol integrations, grants referrals, and contributor referrals.\nThe culmination of published material in the form of blog posts, wiki articles, explainer Twitter threads, and other informational content.\nVarious approved SIPs and proposals for ecosystem protocols were written by members of the Ambassador Council.\n\nSIP 241 was passed in June 2022, making the KPI data in the Q3 2022 Quarterly Report by SNXweave the first epoch that this data was tracked. Going forward, this data will serve as a good baseline to measure the performance of the Ambassador Council over each epoch.\nThe Ambassador Council’s activity in Q3 2022 consisted of the following:\n\nHosted 10 Spartan Spaces.\nResponsible for three successful integrations with other protocols.\nProposed and successfully passed one Synthetix proposal (SCCP 230).\nUtilized Synthetix voting power in the following protocols’ governance: Uniswap, Hop Protocol, Gearbox, Aave, and Optimism.\n\nParticipating in Optimism’s governance during the second half of Optimism’s Grant Funding Season 2 allowed the Ambassador Council to take advantage of being one of the largest Optimism delegates by building relationships with well-recognized protocols for potential partnerships. Some of these protocols include Alchemix, SushiSwap, Yearn, Bankless Academy, EthernautDAO, and Across Protocol.\nThe Ambassador Council meeting and voting participation rates from the Ambassador Council members are as follows:\n\nTreasury Council\nThe partnerships initiated by the Treasury Council are not required through a governance process and be formally voted on, i.e., Jump Crypto providing liquidity and Gauntlet becoming Synthetix’s risk partner. As per SIP 155, the Treasury Council has a broad mandate to do what is in the best interest of the Synthetix Treasury. This includes what is in the best interest of SNX, asset management, and risk management. Warwick has stressed the importance of the Treasury Council having the autonomy to be agile and act in the best interest of Synthetix, especially during a crisis. Thus, the Treasury Council does not have the same checks and balances as the Spartan Council or the other councils.\nWhile the Treasury Council’s activities are more opaque than the other councils, the plan is for the Treasury Council members to complete the same Team 360 Self Review questionnaires the other councils participated in.\nCore Contributor Committee\nThe Core Contributor Committee plays an important role in Synthetix becoming more decentralized; however, all Core Contributor Committee communications, votes, and operations are currently private. The Synthetix community has to blindly trust this committee to act in good faith due to the little transparency and verifiability of the committee's actions. With the ethos of the DAO model being transparent in its communications, private communications feel like a step in the wrong direction.\nSynthetix Governance Looking Forward\nThe announcement of Synthetix V3 created a buzz on Twitter in July 2022, sparking conversations regarding the future of the Synthetix protocol. Synthetix V3 outlines the long-term vision of permissionless asset creation, improved credit control, Liquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS), and a differentiated debt pool. At the time of writing, SIPs 300–312 are all currently in the draft phase, but these proposals aim to migrate Synthetix from V2.X to V3. The transition to V3 will likely be completed in early 2023. V3 will update many of the Synthetix smart contracts and improve Synthetix’s current technical and economic inefficiencies — thus improving the user experience across the Synthetix ecosystem.\nConclusion\nSynthetix is one of the oldest DeFi protocols and is currently in a state of transition as it implements lessons from the DeFi sector into Synthetix V3. Synthetix’s overall focus is to survive and thrive in the long term. A clear example of this can be seen in the successful SIPs and SCCPs that balance user growth while also optimizing for increased revenue to build a sustainable protocol. \nAlthough a few areas of Synthetix Governance could be improved, all the Synthetix Councils have been actively delivering value to the Synthetix protocol. They seem to be acting in good faith on behalf of the Synthetix community while actively trying to drive value back to the Synthetix ecosystem. The upcoming voting (and subsequent implementation) of all the Synthetix V3 SIPs (300–312) means the Synthetix Community should have a lot to look forward to in the new year.\nAppendix\n\nLet us know what you loved about the report, what may be missing, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form.

Traders use the exchange to buy or sell assets. Traditionally, the exchange works in an order-book manner. For example, buyers place an order on the exchange specifying the type and quantity of the asset they want to buy and the maximum price they are willing to pay — a limit order. Sellers do the same.

The AMM model was invented to remove the need for a central entity to match orders and automate trading. It uses a mathematical formula to regulate the pool’s token reserve. Traders do not trade against a counterparty but a smart contract that executes the conditions of the mathematical formula. When people come to trade, the quantity of tokens in the pool changes, i.e trading token A for token B means adding A into and taking B out of the pool. A token’s price relative to the other token(s) in the pool is determined by the ratio of its quantity. That’s how the AMM quotes the price. As a trader, you can only be a taker who accepts the market price but cannot make a limit order. A pain point is that traders may suffer a front-running or sandwich attack from MEV bots, making the orders fail or result in an unfavourable price.

However, handling a large, high-frequency order book still needs to be more efficient. Every action that requires a blockchain transaction consumes data storage. To further improve the efficiency of the matching model, DeGate has designed Batch Spot Trade, a mechanism able to intelligently bundle up and compress many transactions before adding into Layer 2 block. After which, a validity proof is generated through cryptographic means, which is then submitted to Ethereum Mainnet.</p><p>To ensure the system’s accuracy, Batch Spot Trade tracks the token balances amongst the transacted users and the matched transactions.

The takers must consider the order’s size, gas fees and profitability before filling the order. Essentially, it is an arbitrage-driven order matching. If an order is too small or the gas cost is too high, it may not get filled due to a lack of profitability even when the price has matched the requested price. 1inch’s limit order is suitable for large orders, not for small orders.</p><p><em>Gas fee</em></p><p>On DeGate, you don’t need to pre-authorise the gas fee when you do a post-only limit order, meaning you require that the order can only be filled as a maker’s order.

Porting from Ethereum to a Substrate Parachain is now easier since the compiler supports almost all language constructs as Ethereum Solidity 0.8. This release represents just the beginning of a series of upcoming achievements yet to unlock for the Substrate compilation target.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting started with Hyperledger Solang on Substrate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Running your first Solidity contract on Substrate Parachains should be a matter of minutes. In this section we walk you through the few steps, showcasing how to use a classic Solidity example on Substrate. Namely, we are going to deploy an unmodified version of the <a href=\"https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/solidity-by-example.html#voting\">“Voting” example contract</a>, directly out of the Solidity documentation itself. According to Solidity documentation, the “Voting” contract example showcases a lot of Solidity’s features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To follow along, you&#8217;ll need to install Solang version &#8220;0.2.0&#8221; on your system. We offer plenty of quick installation options, including Homebrew as well as pre-built binaries for all common platforms. Please consult our <a href=\"https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html\">documentation</a> for instructions specific to your platform. Impatient readers may as well just use our docker option, which doesn’t require installing anything, instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to test contracts on a local node, you&#8217;ll need to run version &#8220;0.22.1&#8221; of &#8220;substrate-contracts-node&#8221; on your local machine. Installation instructions can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node#installation\">here</a>. Again, our impatient readers may use the &#8220;paritytech/contracts-ci-linux&#8221; Docker image instead as this image contains a compatible substrate node as well (at the time of writing).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Compiling the “Voting” Solidity contract to WASM</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We start with saving the source code of the “Voting” example contract into a file called “ballot.sol.”. There is no need to make any modification to the code, unless you want to tinker around a bit on your own. Now we use “solang” to compile the contract as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bash\nsolang compile --target substrate ballot.sol</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The contract should compile without any warnings. If you prefer docker, you can use the following command instead:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bash\ndocker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/sources ghcr.io/hyperledger/solang:v0.2.0 compile -o /sources --target substrate /sources/ballot.sol</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, inside your current working directory, a new file called &#8220;Ballot.contract&#8221; should appear, containing the web assembly BLOB together with the metadata of the contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Testing on a local development node</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before deploying the compiled contract to a testnet, let&#8217;s try it out on a local node. If you are in a hurry, you may as well skip this section and proceed directly with a deployment to a testnet. Start a local node on your machine using the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bash\nsubstrate-contracts-node --tmp --ws-external -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, the equivalent command for our docker users is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bash\ndocker run --rm -it -p9944:9944 paritytech/contracts-ci-linux substrate-contracts-node --tmp --ws-external -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The odd looking “-lerror,runtime::contracts=debug” CLI option will instruct the node to use the debugging log level for the “contracts” pallet. This might come in handy as it effectively enables using the debug buffer, which allows the contract to communicate with the developer at runtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Deploy the contract using the contracts UI</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now head over to the <a href=\"https://contracts-ui.substrate.io/\">contracts-UI</a> and make sure to select ”Local Node” in the top-left corner. Then click on “Add New Contract” just below, and choose “Upload New Contract Code.” As the Contract Bundle, choose the ”Ballot.contract” file from the previous section. The node we are using comes with some special built-in accounts, which come in very handy for development purposes. The “alice” account is one of them and it is fine to use that for contract instantiation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mTcPBYYmJIyvG4SG413FZenRGMZBd1Shl44FmW1vBjGGAYCDECs_R3DZhFSlpHV6I0Wch7RQbdnrd9wyYnA-w0f3KkHqfUPIAPaEiuYLQ59XNgT9gCoi9BFSN9O4AQkHb2cgzoeg1kLLW3W4vNJDwyTNn-p01O2CUrYLI6SC4gXS61R9aaujiKEMIzFa-A\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption><em>Image 1: Choosing the compiled contract bundle in contracts-UI</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next section, you&#8217;ll be presented with some options for contract instantiation. Primarily, you might want to add some more &#8220;proposalName&#8221;s to our voting Ballot by clicking the big &#8220;+&#8221; button on the right side, so that we can actually choose between different voting options later. The actual values for the ”proposalName” won&#8217;t matter at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ra38b5pR_O6m85EeRcr3Rg97jeBUyrdjQ1eJWqpMrc2HqN9T6HvjoVoXxVvn5PfZoZGxTWaWt-80cGEqaBH-aLsri77PwjIlRatUjNzcGuZy2geskJFj_FWKO51ypakh-vHCvX1RUZbNBTDyYk7AMdLy90Kw3VgsiBBI3gzYMGxK_tyiySgjDSdbH-Jd9g\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption><em>Image 2: Configuring constructor arguments for contract instantiation in contracts UI</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are satisfied with your deployment options, scroll to the bottom of the page to click on “Next” and then “Upload and Instantiate.” Under the hood, this will call the intrinsic to instantiate the contract. As the node we are using is configured to have instant block finality, the operation should succeed immediately. You&#8217;ll find your freshly deployed contract on the left side and it will look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2CNm92gUIz-8srqZzlCxGgCC9vBrKnUcbe874NNkuk1woETpotTr2YnWtQQiu0VcRu4LLw8pgG0GtJAVWo8fhtn0o3l9y7IKvN7ss4sLHhKKlFM0pPF1rdZXaS1mLM6i0OYu8r18VQ0WGLGWyQcjBviuQd_HBxYTiedhKdsG3Ute5V_bccBKP02QmWH6Yg\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption><em>Image 3: The solidity contract deployed to a local node</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Interacting with the contract</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we can start playing with the contract by calling some of its functions. For example, try calling the “giveRightToVote()” function using the “alice” account, to entitle “bob,” “dave” and “eve” with the rights to submit a vote. You&#8217;ll notice that, if you are trying to call the ”vote()” function using an account that was not given voting rights priorly, the contract will trap and the transaction reverts as a consequence. If you did set the log level for the contracts runtime to “debug” in the previous step, you will be able to observe failed “require” statements in your local nodes terminal output. You will find a message like this when trying to submit a “vote()” using a non-entitled account as the caller:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>2022-12-07 18:45:46.496 DEBUG tokio-runtime-worker runtime::contracts: Execution finished with debug buffer: Has no right to vote\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Deploying to a testnet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, let&#8217;s see how we can deploy our ballot contract to the “Rococo” live testnet, turning it into a usable Dapp. For this we are going to use the <a href=\"https://polkadot.js.org/extension/\">polkadot JS browser extension</a> to create some accounts. So make sure to install that in your browser if you don&#8217;t already have it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Creating test accounts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While our local node conveniently provided us with accounts charged up with balance out of the box, this won&#8217;t be the case on any &#8220;real&#8221; network. Instead we will create dedicated accounts. Even though you could reuse any pre-existing value-bearing Accounts from polkadot.js for this experiment, it is considered best practice to always use dedicated throw-away accounts for any development purposes. In your browser, open the polkadot JS extensions and use “Create new Account,” accessible by clicking on the big&nbsp; &#8220;+&#8221; button on the top right side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you successfully created a new account, in the polkadot JS extension, click on the ”gear” sign on the top-right corner and choose “Substrate” under “DISPLAY ADDRESS FORMAT FOR.” This will make polkadot JS to represent your Account ID in the correct address format used on “Rococo.” Naturally, deploying and calling any contract on-chain will cost some value, which is “ROC” tokens in the case of Rococo specifically. You can get some &#8220;ROC&#8221; tokens for free as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Visit the Rococo faucet channel on matrix <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#rococo-faucet:matrix.org\">here</a>.<br>2. Copy your Account ID in the “Substrate” address format and send the following command inside the Rococo faucet channel: &#8220;!drip YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS:1002&#8221; (the &#8220;:1002&#8221; appended to your address is important).<br>3. A bot will respond to you shortly, confirming your balance. After a short while, you should also be able to confirm your balance by visiting the polkadot JS apps using this <a href=\"https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-contracts-rpc.polkadot.io#/accounts\">link</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If something does not work out, you can find more detailed instructions related to the Rococo faucet <a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/blob/master/parachains/runtimes/contracts/contracts-rococo/README.md#rococo-deployment\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Deploying the contract to rococo</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are almost there! Back inside the contracts UI, you can switch to the “Contracts (Rococo)” network using the dropdown menu in the top left corner. Once connected, you are good to use your freshly created account, loaded up with some “ROC” tokens, to deploy the contract. From now on, instantiating your contract and interacting with it works in exactly the same way as on the local node.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wWTlXcG-WJiP-rwTCkE0nCgh96UbetpzH0TLzaesvdKI-5MqlfRhPyRjwu7zBVZPYuSbCbXXwbpo2S5YoyDnq_-cB2Peo8w1cC0VN2QImA99k9_sD7b5UZs9cfHnNu8GNkpK4aYFsPx3SXt7uCR0MUaKyJ4s8XW4UQTjQU2j38NwsI82TX4wkg-1LC7rmA\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption><em>Image Image 4: The solidity contract deployed to the contracts parachain on Rococo</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many congratulations!

At the time of writing, it is only possible to call Solidity contracts from the ink! side in a rather bare-bones way. By implementing all missing primitives and supporting interfaces for bidirectional calls between ink! and Solidity, interacting with both worlds eventually will become a natural thing to do for smart contract authors targeting Substrate-based parachains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A future goal will be to provide Solidity contracts direct access to <a href=\"https://use.ink/macros-attributes/chain-extension\">chain extensions</a>. This will open up a variety of immense benefits. For example, it is the building block for accessing randomness through verifiable random functions without calling into an oracle contract. Ultimately, support for chain extensions will enable using <a href=\"https://polkadot.network/cross-chain-communication/\">XCM</a> within Solidity contracts. So stay tuned for the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hyperledger Solang brings Solidity to many blockchains</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyperledger Solang is designed to bring Solidity support to many blockchains.

Perch is a digital mortgage company. We make money helping people get their mortgage quickly, simply, and at the best rates they qualify for, while providing insights and tools for them to make the best decisions.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor homeowners, Perch will <a href=\"https://myperch.io/tools/pathfinder/\">automatically monitor the </a><strong><a href=\"https://myperch.io/tools/pathfinder/\">mortgage market</a></strong> and let you know when there’s an opportunity to save money by switching mortgages. You’ll also be able to view your monthly property value and mortgage balance updates. Best of all, we can show you exactly how much home equity you could unlock by refinancing and see your property returns as easily as you’d track your stock portfolio.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thefintechstartupplaybook\">The Fintech Startup Playbook</h2>\n<p>I’ll break down what the costs to get to the launch date looked like. Note since we’re a Canadian company, the dollar amounts are listed in Canadian dollars.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1gettingincorporatedd2500\">1. Getting incorporated ($2,500)</h3>\n<p>Setting up the corporation is simple, but you need legal counsel to get things like your bylaws, shareholder agreement, etc., in place. This is extremely important! To raise capital later on, things like the IP belonging to the business and the right shares being issued must be handled correctly the first time. </p>\n<p>\\\nWith that being said, you also don’t want to go into overkill by hiring a $900/hour lawyer and spending $10,000+ on doing this. I used a service called Clausehound, which gave me free access to templates and enabled me to draft rough copies of all legal agreements. I then had to legally validate what I wrote and did one round of edits to minimize my legal costs to around $1,500 for all required documents.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nNote: You need to do this as early as possible. Most accelerators or grant programs require you to be incorporated to qualify, and later on, when you want larger grants, they look for at least 2 years incorporated.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<h3 id=\"2trademarktheapplicationd2000\">2. Trademark the Application ($2,000)</h3>\n<p>I can tell you now that it was a complete waste of money/time. I filed my trademark in early 2018 and didn’t get a response until late 2020, and by that time, we were already gearing up to rebrand. You don’t need to worry about this upfront.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3productmvpd50000\">3. Product MVP ($50,000):</h3>\n<p>As described above, this was about 5 months of development and 3 months of design work.</p>\n<p>\\\nI’ve learned that the equity you retain in your business is commensurate to the pain/risk you can take on.</p>\n<p>:::tip\nSo overall, my total costs from starting up a business to launching were around $55,000.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdidifinanceallofthis\">How Did I Finance All of This?</h2>\n<p>Credits: By joining MaRS and Communitech (we’re based in Canada, and these are research innovation centers specific to my area), I was able to leverage a lot of services to help me reduce costs. Discounted legal/accounting advice, $30,000 in AWS credits, 90% off HubSpot, free-market research, etc. In the first year, 80% of my opex was strictly contractors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1loans\">1. Loans</h3>\n<p>Futurpreneur provides a $15,000 loan that is fairly easy to qualify for. I had a great credit score and no other debts since I was previously working full-time, so that helped me get favorable terms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2capital\">2. Capital</h3>\n<p>I was able to fund the initial startup capital with my savings.

Perch is a digital mortgage company. We make money helping people get their mortgage quickly, simply, and at the best rates they qualify for, while providing insights and tools for them to make the best decisions.\n\\\nFor homeowners, Perch will automatically monitor the mortgage market and let you know when there’s an opportunity to save money by switching mortgages. You’ll also be able to view your monthly property value and mortgage balance updates. Best of all, we can show you exactly how much home equity you could unlock by refinancing and see your property returns as easily as you’d track your stock portfolio.\nThe Fintech Startup Playbook\nI’ll break down what the costs to get to the launch date looked like. Note since we’re a Canadian company, the dollar amounts are listed in Canadian dollars.\n1. Getting incorporated ($2,500)\nSetting up the corporation is simple, but you need legal counsel to get things like your bylaws, shareholder agreement, etc., in place. This is extremely important! To raise capital later on, things like the IP belonging to the business and the right shares being issued must be handled correctly the first time. \n\\\nWith that being said, you also don’t want to go into overkill by hiring a $900/hour lawyer and spending $10,000+ on doing this. I used a service called Clausehound, which gave me free access to templates and enabled me to draft rough copies of all legal agreements. I then had to legally validate what I wrote and did one round of edits to minimize my legal costs to around $1,500 for all required documents.\n\\\n:::info\nNote: You need to do this as early as possible. Most accelerators or grant programs require you to be incorporated to qualify, and later on, when you want larger grants, they look for at least 2 years incorporated.\n:::\n2. Trademark the Application ($2,000)\nI can tell you now that it was a complete waste of money/time. I filed my trademark in early 2018 and didn’t get a response until late 2020, and by that time, we were already gearing up to rebrand. You don’t need to worry about this upfront.\n3. Product MVP ($50,000):\nAs described above, this was about 5 months of development and 3 months of design work.\n\\\nI’ve learned that the equity you retain in your business is commensurate to the pain/risk you can take on.\n:::tip\nSo overall, my total costs from starting up a business to launching were around $55,000.\n:::\nHow Did I Finance All of This?\nCredits: By joining MaRS and Communitech (we’re based in Canada, and these are research innovation centers specific to my area), I was able to leverage a lot of services to help me reduce costs. Discounted legal/accounting advice, $30,000 in AWS credits, 90% off HubSpot, free-market research, etc. In the first year, 80% of my opex was strictly contractors.\n1. Loans\nFuturpreneur provides a $15,000 loan that is fairly easy to qualify for. I had a great credit score and no other debts since I was previously working full-time, so that helped me get favorable terms.\n2. Capital\nI was able to fund the initial startup capital with my savings. The biggest cost that isn’t accounted for here is the “opportunity cost” in the sense that I made $0 for the work I put in, even if I was working 80+ hours a week. Sweat equity was by far the biggest contribution I made, and you should expect it to also be yours.\n3. Grants\nI was able to get $10,000 from the Ontario Centre of Innovation (OCI) for my designer hire.\nThe Startup Lessons\nWe went live to the public in September 2018, and I wanted to use paid channels as the first channel to get my initial customers, I aggressively priced my product to entice someone to try it with no brand recognition.\n\\\n\n  \nThe first thing I learned is that a low price will never trump a bad user experience. If I solely relied on the site to convert, I would’ve had zero clients. \n\\\nThe one thing that made a massive difference was making sure my phone number was easily visible and that I got their info as early as possible so I could reach out. Getting people on the phone and getting feedback on the product was fundamental in helping me rapidly iterate on the product and keep improving.\n\\\nMy goal was never to flood the site with traffic but rather to keep a steady stream of people coming in so that I could keep testing my product and getting feedback in a measured and controlled way. If anything, my worst nightmare was having my site go viral and then having tons of people access the site when we couldn't support them all, which could lead to damaging the brand.\n\\\nThe team was 3 people (me, an intermediate engineer, and a junior designer), so we had to pick wisely on where we spent our efforts. My product also requires consultation as a mortgage broker, so I wasn’t in a position where I could handle 100 clients at a time.\nHow to Attract and Retain Customers\nFor anyone who’s thinking about starting a business, I always recommend expanding your network beyond just your immediate role. For example, attend networking events where not everyone has a similar background to you. My background is in finance, so I had the ‘fin’ but none of the ‘tech.’ To overcome part of this knowledge gap, I signed up for online courses and dedicated myself to reading as much as I could so I could “speak the language” during the hiring process and when working with my entire team.\n\\\nSince launching our free analytics platform to home buyers and homeowners, we’ve enjoyed a 174% customer referral rate.

Here are some questions that all candidates should ask during their next remote interview:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1whatistheinterviewprocesslike\"><strong>1. What is the interview process like?</strong></h3>\n<p>It's a good idea to ask first what the interview process is, especially if there are multiple stages of interviews before getting hired. This will help you become more prepared through the process, <a href=\"https://dailyremote.com/remote-work-blog/mistakes-avoid-apply-remote-job/\">avoid any mistakes while applying for the remote job</a>, and indicate to your interviewer how ready you are for those stages if any.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2howdoyouworkremotely\"><strong>2. How do you work remotely?</strong></h3>\n<p>The nature of your work, the applications used to monitor workflow, and many other systems might be different for your work when in the office versus when working remotely. Make sure to ask about the nature of your work when working remotely and what systems you need to adapt to.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/dekqFKbCjYP7GoUnRP2jptMYXsC3-2022-12-13T14:01:04.306Z-clbmakl6c000h0as66k7caaml\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"3howmanyleavesdoyougrantperyearwhileworkingremotely\"><strong>3. How many leaves do you grant per year while working remotely?</strong></h3>\n<p>Company policy might change the amount of leave you can have when working remotely versus when reporting on-site. Clear this up with your employer, noting the different kinds of leave and whether working remotely can affect their policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4whatwouldbethetimelineoftheinterviewprocess\"><strong>4. What would be the timeline of the interview process?</strong></h3>\n<p>This question ties in with the first question about the interview process. Ask what the dates would be between the process and when you would be informed if you passed the next stage so that you can schedule accordingly and prepare accordingly for the process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5whatistheexpectedtimezoneyourteamworksin\"><strong>5. What is the expected time zone your team works in?</strong></h3>\n<p>Depending on the company, you might have to interact with a team that lives worldwide and in different time zones. Ask the timezone that the team you would potentially be working with works on, and make sure that you can meet with them and work with them in that timezone.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/dekqFKbCjYP7GoUnRP2jptMYXsC3-2022-12-13T14:01:04.312Z-clbmakl6g000i0as60wlb9bfe\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"6howdothisjobsfirst3060and90dayslooklike\"><strong>6. How do this job's first 30, 60, and 90 days look like?</strong></h3>\n<p>This question gives you a rough idea of how you would progress and adjust within your work role. Would you be given training for your work? Will the company have an upcoming big project, and are you more likely to work overtime in the next 30, 60, and 90 days? This question would answer those supplemental questions and help you succeed in the remote role.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7isthisroleremotehybridorinperson\"><strong>7. Is this role remote, hybrid or in-person?</strong></h3>\n<p>Clarify if remote work means you can stay remote forever or if there are plans for employees to return to the office in the next few months. Depending on the answer, consider if the job is something you would want and could adjust to. It is essential to understand if the role is fully remote or hybrid.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8whatgrowthoptionsareavailableinthisroleafterayearortwo\"><strong>8. What growth options are available in this role after a year or two?</strong></h3>\n<p>This question relates more to training and, more importantly, promotions. Does the company frequently promote employees? Are you given enough training for this promotion and your subsequent role expansion? Ensure that the company provides enough opportunities to its employees for growth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9howwouldyoudescribetheremoteworkculture\"><strong>9. How would you describe the remote work culture?</strong></h3>\n<p>A dramatic change in work dynamics would be in the office work culture versus remote work. You won't be able to see or access your coworkers as often, and this would result in a culture change. Ask about the current culture in the company and how remote work has affected it. Then decide if that culture is the right fit for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10howdoestheteamcommunicateremotely\"><strong>10. How does the team communicate remotely?</strong></h3>\n<p>Remote work communication can either be email or message-heavy (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication\">asynchronous</a>), or meetings-heavy (or synchronous).

What are the day-to-day responsibilities of the role?</strong></h3>\n<p>This basic question should be asked for any role, not just a remote job. You should understand at least what to expect in working for a remote company daily.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12whatremotetoolsdoyouusetocollaborate\"><strong>12. What remote tools do you use to collaborate?</strong></h3>\n<p>From communication channels like <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/company/slack\">Slack</a> to scheduling apps like GanttPro, and collaboration apps like Miro, there are many applications that you can use for remote work to make it easier to collaborate and communicate with the team. Ask the interviewer what remote working tools are being used so that you can more easily adjust to the role by learning more about these applications and how they work.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/dekqFKbCjYP7GoUnRP2jptMYXsC3-2022-12-13T14:01:04.314Z-clbmakl6i000k0as6ammn8l6v\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"13howdoyouprovidefeedbacktoremoteemployees\"><strong>13. How do you provide feedback to remote employees?</strong></h3>\n<p>Feedback is critical to a company as it can gauge employee performance and determine who is underperforming. Ask how this feedback is obtained and provided, so you won't be unprepared for your job.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14whatarethebenefitsprovidedtoremoteemployees\"><strong>14. What are the benefits provided to remote employees?</strong></h3>\n<p>Again, this is another question that should be asked in any job. However, there might be some changes to the benefits that remote workers receive depending on the company you are working for. Clear this up as soon as possible with your remote company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"15doesthecompanyholdteammeetups\"><strong>15. Does the company hold team meetups?</strong></h3>\n<p>Due to the remote work policy, as said before, the culture and dynamic of the company and the team might be different than with in-office teams. The company might hold separate team meetups to ensure that teams can still interact with each other, even if it's not regularly.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/dekqFKbCjYP7GoUnRP2jptMYXsC3-2022-12-13T14:01:04.350Z-clbmakl7i000m0as655ar5ut0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"16whatisyourremoteworkpolicy\"><strong>16. What is your remote work policy?</strong></h3>\n<p>Make sure to clear up the specifics of the company's remote work policy so that you know what your setup would be and if it's a permanent or temporary arrangement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"17howdoyouhelpyourteamworkfromhome\"><strong>17. How do you help your team work from home?</strong></h3>\n<p>Companies usually give remote workers adequate work-from-home tools and devices to help them work remotely. There might be some other benefits the company provides; ask about them with your interviewer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"18howdoesthecompanyfocusonremoteteambuilding\"><strong>18. How does the company focus on remote team-building?</strong></h3>\n<p>Remote companies alleviate team dynamics and culture problems through various activities, including virtual remote team-building. Ask the company about these activities and how they help the team work together more effectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"19whatarethecompanystopgoalsforthefuture\"><strong>19. What are the company's top goals for the future?</strong></h3>\n<p>Understanding the company's projects and plans and where they're headed might give you more information about how you want to proceed with your future and whether or not you see yourself staying with the company for a long time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"20howdoyouovercomechallengesregardingremotework\"><strong>20. How do you overcome challenges regarding remote work?</strong></h3>\n<p>As said before, there are many challenges that remote work brings to the table, from collaboration and communication problems to different timezones to struggles with devices and more. Ask the company how they plan to overcome these challenges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"21whatcaniexpectthedaytodaytolooklikeinthisrole\"><strong>21. What can I expect the day-to-day to look like in this role?</strong></h3>\n<p>Make sure to ask about the day-to-day responsibilities of your role so you have an understanding of the job at hand and so that you are always prepared for everything thrown at you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"22whatarethemostchallengingaspectsofthisremotejob\"><strong>22.

Does the company provide remote employees with a remote work setup?</strong></h3>\n<p>Depending on the company, they might offer remote employees a setup (laptop, mouse, etc.) to work remotely. Make sure to take this benefit if they provide it so that you can fully utilize the company's benefits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtonailaremotejobinterview\"><strong>How to Nail A Remote Job Interview</strong></h2>\n<p>Asking these questions will ensure that you are adequately prepared for the remote interview, and the role you're about to take and that you will be able to integrate well with the team you're going to work with (whether they work remotely or on-site).</p>\n<p>\\\nRemember to be fully informed about the company and its plans so that you can plan your future as a company member.

Remote companies save time and money on travel expenses and determine if the candidate is a good fit for your team.\n\\\nRemote interviews are usually done by video conferencing, over the phone, or via Zoom, with the interviewer sitting at their desk and the candidate sitting in their living room or office.\nRemote interviews have many benefits for both employers and employees. Employers get to evaluate candidates based on who they are and what they look like without worrying about geographical location.\nWhat is a Remote Interview?\nA remote interview is a type of interview where the candidate and interviewer are not in the same location. Remote interviews can be done using various communication technologies, including Skype, Google Hangouts, Zoom, or phone.\n\\\nRemote interviews are becoming more common because they offer employers several benefits. They allow companies to hire candidates who live in areas where there is a lack of qualified candidates. They also enable companies to hire candidates from all over the world.\nTips to Ace A Remote Job Interview\nIn a remote interview, the interviewer and the interviewee are not in the same physical location; thus, you can succeed only if you possess the required skills to land a remote job.\n\\\nThe following are some tips for remote workers to nail the remote job interview:\n\\\n\nBe sure to have a good internet connection to communicate with your interviewer without any issues.\nMake sure that you're comfortable with your surroundings - if it's too noisy or bright where you are, it'll affect how you sound on the phone.\nPrepare before the interview so that you know what to expect. Dress appropriately and be ready to answer questions about yourself and your work experience.\nDo your research on the company, its culture, and its values beforehand to understand its company culture and values better when you speak with them.\nMake sure to have your resume or CV handy during the interview so they can see it before deciding whether or not to hire you.\nAnswer questions about yourself upfront before they ask them because this will help them understand who you are.\nTop Questions Candidates Should Ask During A Remote Interview\nRemote interviews are becoming more popular as companies look for ways to reduce costs and hire people who live in remote areas or time zones and don't want to relocate.\n\\\nIf you're a candidate, it's important that you ask the right questions during your next remote interview, as it is an important part of finding the right remote job. Here are some questions that all candidates should ask during their next remote interview:\n1. What is the interview process like?\nIt's a good idea to ask first what the interview process is, especially if there are multiple stages of interviews before getting hired. This will help you become more prepared through the process, avoid any mistakes while applying for the remote job, and indicate to your interviewer how ready you are for those stages if any.\n2. How do you work remotely?\nThe nature of your work, the applications used to monitor workflow, and many other systems might be different for your work when in the office versus when working remotely. Make sure to ask about the nature of your work when working remotely and what systems you need to adapt to.\n\\\n \n3. How many leaves do you grant per year while working remotely?\nCompany policy might change the amount of leave you can have when working remotely versus when reporting on-site. Clear this up with your employer, noting the different kinds of leave and whether working remotely can affect their policy.\n4. What would be the timeline of the interview process?\nThis question ties in with the first question about the interview process. Ask what the dates would be between the process and when you would be informed if you passed the next stage so that you can schedule accordingly and prepare accordingly for the process.\n5. What is the expected time zone your team works in?\nDepending on the company, you might have to interact with a team that lives worldwide and in different time zones. Ask the timezone that the team you would potentially be working with works on, and make sure that you can meet with them and work with them in that timezone.\n\\\n \n6. How do this job's first 30, 60, and 90 days look like?\nThis question gives you a rough idea of how you would progress and adjust within your work role. Would you be given training for your work? Will the company have an upcoming big project, and are you more likely to work overtime in the next 30, 60, and 90 days? This question would answer those supplemental questions and help you succeed in the remote role.\n7. Is this role remote, hybrid or in-person?\nClarify if remote work means you can stay remote forever or if there are plans for employees to return to the office in the next few months. Depending on the answer, consider if the job is something you would want and could adjust to. It is essential to understand if the role is fully remote or hybrid.\n8. What growth options are available in this role after a year or two?\nThis question relates more to training and, more importantly, promotions. Does the company frequently promote employees? Are you given enough training for this promotion and your subsequent role expansion? Ensure that the company provides enough opportunities to its employees for growth.\n9. How would you describe the remote work culture?\nA dramatic change in work dynamics would be in the office work culture versus remote work. You won't be able to see or access your coworkers as often, and this would result in a culture change. Ask about the current culture in the company and how remote work has affected it. Then decide if that culture is the right fit for you.\n10. How does the team communicate remotely?\nRemote work communication can either be email or message-heavy (or asynchronous), or meetings-heavy (or synchronous). Whichever you prefer, make sure to ask about it, then prepare to adapt to that communication system to be more effective in your work and talking to your team.\n\\\n \n11. What are the day-to-day responsibilities of the role?\nThis basic question should be asked for any role, not just a remote job. You should understand at least what to expect in working for a remote company daily.\n12. What remote tools do you use to collaborate?\nFrom communication channels like Slack to scheduling apps like GanttPro, and collaboration apps like Miro, there are many applications that you can use for remote work to make it easier to collaborate and communicate with the team. Ask the interviewer what remote working tools are being used so that you can more easily adjust to the role by learning more about these applications and how they work.\n\\\n \n13. How do you provide feedback to remote employees?\nFeedback is critical to a company as it can gauge employee performance and determine who is underperforming. Ask how this feedback is obtained and provided, so you won't be unprepared for your job.\n14. What are the benefits provided to remote employees?\nAgain, this is another question that should be asked in any job. However, there might be some changes to the benefits that remote workers receive depending on the company you are working for. Clear this up as soon as possible with your remote company.\n15. Does the company hold team meetups?\nDue to the remote work policy, as said before, the culture and dynamic of the company and the team might be different than with in-office teams. The company might hold separate team meetups to ensure that teams can still interact with each other, even if it's not regularly.\n\\\n \n16. What is your remote work policy?\nMake sure to clear up the specifics of the company's remote work policy so that you know what your setup would be and if it's a permanent or temporary arrangement.\n17. How do you help your team work from home?\nCompanies usually give remote workers adequate work-from-home tools and devices to help them work remotely. There might be some other benefits the company provides; ask about them with your interviewer.\n18. How does the company focus on remote team-building?\nRemote companies alleviate team dynamics and culture problems through various activities, including virtual remote team-building. Ask the company about these activities and how they help the team work together more effectively.\n19. What are the company's top goals for the future?\nUnderstanding the company's projects and plans and where they're headed might give you more information about how you want to proceed with your future and whether or not you see yourself staying with the company for a long time.\n20. How do you overcome challenges regarding remote work?\nAs said before, there are many challenges that remote work brings to the table, from collaboration and communication problems to different timezones to struggles with devices and more. Ask the company how they plan to overcome these challenges.\n21. What can I expect the day-to-day to look like in this role?\nMake sure to ask about the day-to-day responsibilities of your role so you have an understanding of the job at hand and so that you are always prepared for everything thrown at you.\n22. What are the most challenging aspects of this remote job?\nAsking about the most challenging part of the job can help you prepare for the role you will take in the company. You can start planning how to work around that challenge and be a more effective remote worker.\n23. How would you describe the remote work environment in the company?\nAgain, this question has more to do with worker culture, dynamics, and how they integrate and collaborate. It's an important question to ask so that you can start adapting to that environment, too.\n\\\n \n24. How much of the team works remotely?\nAsk this question to schedule around and collaborate better with those who work remotely and those who don't.\n25. Does the company provide remote employees with a remote work setup?\nDepending on the company, they might offer remote employees a setup (laptop, mouse, etc.) to work remotely. Make sure to take this benefit if they provide it so that you can fully utilize the company's benefits.\nHow to Nail A Remote Job Interview\nAsking these questions will ensure that you are adequately prepared for the remote interview, and the role you're about to take and that you will be able to integrate well with the team you're going to work with (whether they work remotely or on-site).\n\\\nRemember to be fully informed about the company and its plans so that you can plan your future as a company member. When it comes to a remote job interview, preparation is vital. Prepping for a remote job interview can often feel overwhelming, but it is worth it.\n\\\n\nAlso published here.","dc:creator":"Daniel","content":"Remote interviews are becoming a more popular way of interviewing candidates.

We look at our metrics to see how our system is doing, whether on the infrastructure, the application, or the business level. We trust our metrics to show us the status of our system and where it misbehaves. But do our metrics show us what really happened? You’d be surprised how often it’s not the case.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this post I will look into the math and mechanics behind metrics, some common misconceptions, what it takes to have accurate metrics, and if there even is such a thing.</p>\n<h1 id=\"metricsessentials\">Metrics essentials</h1>\n<p>Metrics are essentially roll-ups of raw events. During this roll-up process, the events are translated into numerical data points. A simple example is errors occurring in the system, with a simple metric to count the errors. Metrics can also involve multiple variables, such as a count of requests with a response time higher than 1 second. When measured over time, these data points form a <em>time series</em>.</p>\n<p>\\\nMetrics can be of various types, such as Counters, Gauges, and Histograms. <em>Counters</em> are used for the cumulative counting of events, as we saw in the above examples. <em>Gauges</em> typically represent the latest value of measurement. And then there are more elaborate types such as <em>Histograms</em> that can sample the <em>distribution</em> of metric values, by counting events in configurable “buckets” or “bins”. For example, you may want to understand the memory usage percent segmented by pods across your cluster in given points in time.</p>\n<h1 id=\"themechanicsofmetrics\">The mechanics of metrics</h1>\n<p>In an ideal world, we would ingest and store all the raw events, and then calculate the metrics on query time. This would allow us to slice and dice the events in any way we need, and ask any ad-hoc questions we desire.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the real world, however, keeping all the raw events for extended periods of time can be prohibitively expensive, due to the high volumes of data. To overcome this, events are frequently rolled up into metrics in the collection pipeline, while discarding the raw events or retaining them for short periods only. This is oftentimes a matter of a simple configuration in your metrics collector agent.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn addition to reducing cost, aggregation upon collection can improve the performance of real-time analytics with higher metric transmission and ingestion rates at a higher frequency, and by avoiding heavy aggregations and calculations on query time.</p>\n<h1 id=\"themathofmetricsinanutshell\">The math of metrics in a nutshell</h1>\n<p>This rolling-up process involves some math. We might want to calculate the mean or median of the response times, or maybe a percentile, or an aggregation over a time window. We might also want to roll up multiple events into one composite metric. For example, I may want to calculate the 95th percentile (commonly known as P95) of all the pods of a specific service across my cluster.</p>\n<p>\\\nEven if you don’t like math, you cannot avoid it with metrics. You need to understand the different aggregation functions, and the relation between the question you wish to ask and the metric and aggregate you need in order to answer it. Let’s look at the Average function as an example, as many tend to start there. Averages, by definition, smoothen things up and will be less suitable for flushing out anomalous behavior and outliers. When investigating latency problems, for example, it will be quite useless to look at average metric values, and you’d be better off looking at percentiles.</p>\n<h1 id=\"determineyourquestionsdesignyourmetricsaccordingly\">Determine your questions, design your metrics accordingly</h1>\n<p>In a way, you can think about these metrics as a lossy compression, during which we lose data and context from the raw events. If we don’t keep the raw events, then we need to determine upfront what’s important for us. For example, if I only calculate the average value over the data, I will not be able to ask about the P95 (95th percentile) later over the pre-aggregated data.</p>\n<p>\\\nYou need to determine what questions you want to answer, what’s important for you, and design your metrics and aggregations accordingly. A common mistake is that people avoid this design phase, and just use the preset metrics and default values provided out of the box with their metrics collector of choice. While you may think these defaults represent some industry standard, these are oftentimes quite legacy, and in most cases won’t be in tune with your specific needs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/t9hpWv7fVSk?t=555?embedable=true\">https://youtu.be/t9hpWv7fVSk?t=555?embedable=true</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"themeasurementproblem\">The measurement problem</h1>\n<p>Just like in physics, the measurement problem occurs when we measure a (seemingly) continuous property at discrete intervals, often called the <em>sampling interval</em>, which determines the <em>sampling rate.</em> This creates a distorted representation, where the metric may not actually reflect the originally measured property. For example, if we measure the CPU utilization every 60 seconds, then any CPU outlier happening between these sampling points will be invisible to us. </p>\n<p>\\\nMoreover, in order to draw a consecutive line, visualization tools oftentimes average over consecutive data points, which gives the misleading appearance of a smooth line. On some occasions the opposite can occur, where you can get artifacts in your metrics that aren’t real, like peaks in your metrics that don’t really exist. This can happen when running aggregations within the storage backend, due to the in which the calculation is being made.</p>\n<h1 id=\"meantimetodetection\">Mean time to detection</h1>\n<p>The sampling period also influences how fast a change in the system will be visible in the metrics. Most algorithms require five data points to detect a trend. If the sampling interval is 60 sec, then the simple math determines that it will take five minutes (that is, 60 sec X 5 data points) before we see something is wrong. Could you afford to wait 5 minutes to know that your system crashed? Using shorter sampling intervals (i.e. higher sampling rates) will shorten this period and enable us to detect and react faster. Of course, higher sampling rates incur overhead in CPU and storage, so we need to find the configuration that strikes the right balance for our needs.</p>\n<h1 id=\"varyingresolutionanddownscaling\">Varying resolution and downscaling</h1>\n<p>A common practice is to save metrics in different resolutions in a tiered approach, to reduce cost. For example, you may want to save the metric every 10 seconds for the first day, but then every 5 minutes for the next week, and perhaps every 1 hour for the month or more ahead. This practice assumes that we need the finest granularity for the near real-time period, which we may need it if there’s an issue in the system, while investigations over longer periods require larger-scale trends.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe different granularities can be achieved by downscaling the metrics, namely calculating the less granular metric off of the higher granularity one. While this sounds perfectly reasonable, math can interfere here, as some aggregation functions are not compatible with certain computations, and can therefore not be aggregated later. For example, percentiles are not additive and cannot be summed up. So, following the above example, if you have a P99 percentile sampled with 10 seconds resolution, you can’t roll them up to a 5-minute resolution. It’s important to be cognizant of the compatibility of the aggregation functions, and when using non-compatible functions such as percentiles, to make design decisions about which resolutions we require, and calculate these time series upfront.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe varying resolution is not limited only to the time factor. Another example is saving per-pod data, and then wishing to “group by” nodes or clusters. The same constraint applies here, meaning that if we expect to be interested in slicing and dicing a percentile-based metric per node, per region, per namespace, or across the entire cluster, we need to pre-aggregate accordingly.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnother approach is to give up the accuracy of measurements to gain compatibility in computation, by using histograms. You can take histograms of a few servers and sum them up, or histograms of several time windows and sum them up, and then to downscale. The problem is that in this case, percentiles will be estimates rather than accurate. It’s also important to note that histograms are more time-consuming in storage and throughput, as every sample is not just a single number but a few samples (one per bucket).</p>\n<h1 id=\"summary\">Summary</h1>\n<p>Metrics are a powerful way to monitor our applications. But they are not necessarily representative of the actual system’s state. It requires an understanding of the math and nature of metrics, as well as careful design, to make sure our metrics are indeed useful to answer the questions we need. Having access to the raw data in addition to the metrics is always good, as this is ultimately the source of truth.</p>\n<p>\\\nWant to learn more?

Sherman urged, referring to the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, which Bankman-Fried advocated for prior to the exchange’s public collapse. \nAs of Tuesday morning, Bankman-Fried is the only person associated with FTX who faces criminal charges. \nWhen asked if Bankman-Fried’s right-hand associates, namely Ryan Salame, co-CEO of FTX, and Caroline Ellison, Alameda Research’s CEO, would face prosecution, Ray only said his team would turn over any relevant information found.\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nCan’t wait?

Each of these “must-haves” is a crucial success criterion for modernizing your secure remote access without compromising user experience or the cybersecurity posture of your OT infrastructure. </span></p>\n<h5>1. Enforces least-privilege access control</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cyberattackers often compromise privileged accounts to expand their access in a target environment. Enforcing the principle of least privilege is a crucial cybersecurity control for your remote access strategy. IT-centric access tools are only partially applicable to OT/ICS environments. While IT-centric remote access tools can integrate with privileged access management (PAM) to enforce least privilege, they usually require agents on the assets. This makes them inapplicable to many OT asset types, such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and remote terminal units (RTUs). This is an unacceptable compromise for critical infrastructure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for a remote access solution that shifts from a traditional network-centric to an identity-centric security model while accounting for OT’s unique access control challenges. To achieve this, your secure remote access solution must create an individual identity for every asset regardless of native device controls. Only when each identity forms its own perimeter can you consistently enact and enforce granular access policies across your OT, IT, and cloud networks.   </span></p>\n<h5>2. Takes an asset-centric approach</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the heart of every industrial organization are the mission-critical OT/ICS assets (devices such as PLCs, RTUs, sensors, actuators, etc.) that comprise your operations. These assets should be the central focus of your secure remote access strategy. Any remote access solution must be able to provide the appropriate level of access, for the required amount of time, to individual OT assets. Any solution offering less granular control, such as a VPN that default-allows access to an entire network segment, is insufficient for OT/ICS environments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider secure remote access solutions that are </span><a href=\"https://xage.com/blog/asset-centric-protection-for-cyber-physical-systems/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purpose-built for OT</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You’ll benefit from a solution that overlays and augments the different native security capabilities of your operational systems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your remote access solution must have a deep understanding of the unique relationships and behaviors of different OT assets to effectively safeguard all digital interactions and data transfers between devices, applications, and users.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absent this awareness, your OT security teams will struggle to create and enforce granular remote access policies. One misconfiguration could impede productivity, threaten operational safety, or leave your environment vulnerable to cyberattack.</span></p>\n<h5>3. Preserves security layers across OT, IT, and cloud interconnectivity</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of remote connectivity are undeniable. However, you need to be wary of any remote access solution that exposes vulnerable protocols and at-risk OT devices directly to the internet.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years, operations security relied on physical separation between OT systems and IT environments. The “airgap” provided a sense of security that is rapidly dissipating as digital transformation projects drive the need for interconnectivity between OT, IT, and Cloud assets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, your remote access solution must preserve logical segmentation while enabling secure traversal of multiple network layers. This includes utilizing a multi-hop architecture that provides session and protocol termination at each layer without added complexity or friction for the remote user. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll also want to look for a secure remote access solution that eliminates the need to open multiple firewall ports to provide remote connectivity via common protocols (e.g., SSH, VNC, PROFINET). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, your remote access solution must achieve these outcomes without disrupting your existing operations infrastructure. Instead, aim to implement an approach that overlays your environment, OT-IT DMZ, and the cloud. Avoid any solution that requires you to rip and replace any part of your architecture.</span></p>\n<h5>4. Delivers complete visibility of remote access activity</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot can happen during a remote session into your OT infrastructure that affects operational productivity and your cyber-physical systems security posture. Remote access tools that “black box” activities at the network edge limit early detection and cause slow cyber-incident remediation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure to adopt a secure remote access solution that provides full visibility into all remote session activity. Your solution must take an identity-aware approach to activity logging, auditing, and session tracing, even if the participating devices lack unique user accounts. Anything less leaves operations teams with more questions than answers when every minute a production process is impacted can lead to thousands (if not millions) in lost revenue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identity-enriched visibility into OT remote access speeds forensics for incident response, even offering proactive protection against anomalous behaviors.

The CosmWasm contracts are intended to facilitate cross-chain swaps.\nAggarwal pointed to Cosmos’ multi-chain vision opening up new prospects for the DEX. “The other big thing would be being able to use it for fungible buying across different versions of the same asset — where we can bring the same asset by different bridges, but swap really easily between the different versions of the same asset.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nCan’t wait?

At the time, Uniswap v1 only supported ETH-ERC20 trading pairs and liquidity pools (LPs).</p><p>In May 2020, Uniswap v2 launched as an improvement upon v1.

All in all, the main thesis of Uniswap v3 was to achieve better capital efficiency for the platform’s traders and the liquidity providers through the concept of <strong>concentrated liquidity.</strong></p><p><strong>What is concentrated liquidity? What benefits does it bring?</strong></p><p>As opposed to AMMs, where liquidity is simply provided without specifying a range, concentrated liquidity means LPs can allocate capital to their preferred price intervals, which allows for a significantly higher capital efficiency.</p><p>Concentrated liquidity benefits <em>all</em> parties: traders and LPs.</p><p>LPs benefit from the capital efficiency of providing a narrow range of liquidity, generally which is utilized more by traders, which consequently can generate up to<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1374407493741256711\"><strong>4000x more fees</strong></a> compared to Uniswap v2.</p><p>Traders, in turn, benefit from the deeper liquidity</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/878/0*DHWXFnUB8iohu87K\" /></figure><p>Uniswap V3 saw strong adoption from the crypto community thanks to its new concentrated liquidity model.

And all of this, with the full benefits of a DEX: decentralized, secure, and transparent end-to-end transactions for traders and liquidity providers.</p><p>On Ref v2 you can..</p><ol><li><strong>Enjoy high capital efficiency thanks to the Discretized Liquidity AMM</strong></li></ol><p>Just like on Uni v3, Ref v2 enables you to provide concentrated liquidity — i.e. liquidity that is specific to a price range. This means that as an LP you are able to provide liquidity to a price range that you think traders utilize more, for instance, and potentially collect way more fees than before. As a trader, you can potentially enjoy deeper liquidity in the price ranges that you frequent, as liquidity doesn’t have to be spread out across the entire range anymore.</p><p><strong>2. Enjoy Uni V3-style AMM at a fraction of the speed and costs</strong></p><p>By leveraging NEAR, Ref is able to offer its discretized liquidity AMM with incredibly fast finality (1–2s) and at negligible costs (fractions of a penny).</p><p><strong>3. Place limit orders</strong></p><p>By definition, a limit order is an order to buy or sell an asset with a restriction on the maximum price to be paid or the minimum price at which you sell. This is a typical feature on CEXs that use an orderbook, which allows users to program orders within their preferred price range.</p><p>Currently, there isn’t a proper limit order function on Uniswap v3. The only way is to provide concentrated liquidity outside the current price and thus <em>mimic</em> a limit order. Ref v2, on the other hand, introduces built-in limit order functionality. Now users can trade on a DEX like they normally would on a CEX 🤯</p><p><strong>4. Place limit orders without price limitations</strong></p><p>As Uni v3 only allows for limit orders in a roundabout way, once the synthetic limit order is filled, if or when the price returns to its original point, LPs are no longer able to claim their order earnings as the earned tokens would have been reverted.</p><p>On Ref v2, users can place limit buy orders at a price higher than current price, and the algorithm will then auto match with the best price. This further provides a trading experience akin to CEXs<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Place limit orders with near-zero slippage</strong></p><p>Thanks to Ref’s discretized liquidity AMM, which leverages the power of a constant sum formula, traders can not only place limit orders, but do so with <em>near-zero slippage</em>.</p><p>Moreover, when traders place limit orders on Ref v2, they effectively become temporary LPs to that pool in that price range. Aside from the state of the art DLAMM model itself, Ref v2’s limit order capacity effectively adds additional liquidity into the pools, thus reducing even more slippage.</p><p><strong>6. Benefit from limit order priority AND fair LP fee structure</strong></p><p>The introduction of the limit order liquidity provider on Ref v2 naturally introduces competition on fees with the regular LPs who provide concentrated liquidity. To best incentivize each party, limit orders will always be prioritized in terms of the order of transaction, but the LP fees will be distributed proportionally to the concentrated liquidity providers.</p><h4><strong>Why should YOU care?</strong></h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2cbeE9Njicqz5sufRZXnyA.png\" /></figure><p>Tldr; Discretized Liquidity AMM is a positive sum game. <em>Everybody wins on Ref V2.</em></p><ol><li>Liquidity Providers: Like on Uni v3, LPs on Ref v2 can maximize the transaction fees they collect from trades by providing concentrated liquidity into a specific price range that traders frequent. In addition, LPs also receive all the fees generated from limit order trades. When a limit order gets filled, it is not the trader who receive the transaction fee, but rather the underlying LP within that range.</li><li>Traders: Traders are able to enjoy deeper liquidity now, as well as place market orders and limit orders with near-zero slippage.

Place limit orders\nBy definition, a limit order is an order to buy or sell an asset with a restriction on the maximum price to be paid or the minimum price at which you sell. This is a typical feature on CEXs that use an orderbook, which allows users to program orders within their preferred price range.\nCurrently, there isn’t a proper limit order function on Uniswap v3. The only way is to provide concentrated liquidity outside the current price and thus mimic a limit order. Ref v2, on the other hand, introduces built-in limit order functionality. Now users can trade on a DEX like they normally would on a CEX 🤯\n4. Place limit orders without price limitations\nAs Uni v3 only allows for limit orders in a roundabout way, once the synthetic limit order is filled, if or when the price returns to its original point, LPs are no longer able to claim their order earnings as the earned tokens would have been reverted.\nOn Ref v2, users can place limit buy orders at a price higher than current price, and the algorithm will then auto match with the best price. This further provides a trading experience akin to CEXs.\n5. Place limit orders with near-zero slippage\nThanks to Ref’s discretized liquidity AMM, which leverages the power of a constant sum formula, traders can not only place limit orders, but do so with near-zero slippage.\nMoreover, when traders place limit orders on Ref v2, they effectively become temporary LPs to that pool in that price range. Aside from the state of the art DLAMM model itself, Ref v2’s limit order capacity effectively adds additional liquidity into the pools, thus reducing even more slippage.\n6. Benefit from limit order priority AND fair LP fee structure\nThe introduction of the limit order liquidity provider on Ref v2 naturally introduces competition on fees with the regular LPs who provide concentrated liquidity. To best incentivize each party, limit orders will always be prioritized in terms of the order of transaction, but the LP fees will be distributed proportionally to the concentrated liquidity providers.\nWhy should YOU care?\n\nTldr; Discretized Liquidity AMM is a positive sum game. Everybody wins on Ref V2.\n\nLiquidity Providers: Like on Uni v3, LPs on Ref v2 can maximize the transaction fees they collect from trades by providing concentrated liquidity into a specific price range that traders frequent. In addition, LPs also receive all the fees generated from limit order trades. When a limit order gets filled, it is not the trader who receive the transaction fee, but rather the underlying LP within that range.\nTraders: Traders are able to enjoy deeper liquidity now, as well as place market orders and limit orders with near-zero slippage. When traders place limit orders, they effectively become liquidity providers, who “make markets” by placing offers onto the exchange.\nActive Market Makers: Market makers can reduce the cost of LP management to a much affordable rate(<$0.01/txn), with more predictable profit and loss (PnL), and trading experience closer to a CLOB exchange.\n\n“Tldr; DL-AMM is a positive sum game”\nContact Author\nAuthor’s Twitter\nOfficial Ref Finance Twitter\nRef Finance V2 Testnet\nRef Finance App\nDisclaimer\nRef Finance does not endorse or promote any of the projects, platforms or cryptocurrencies mentioned in this blogpost.

A cryptographic proof of liabilities, verifiable by any party without relying on a trusted auditor, was first proposed by Greg Maxwell in 2013, and is known as the Maxwell protocol.This initial proposal disclosed information about the number and size of customer accounts, which is why Deribit is using a slightly modified version that protects client privacy and offers full transparency, preventing balances from being hidden.</p>\n<p>Deribit constructed a binary Merkle hash overview with the leaves being the steganographed (cut in-pieces) balances of our individual users, broken up by asset. Clients can see exactly which leaves in the tree refer to their funds by using the unique hash built from their account information. With the individual liabilities established, it can be easily verified whether the aggregate of these liabilities is held by Deribit on-chain.</p>\n<p>The daily snapshot file can be found <a style=\"color: #1bcfbe;\" href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/proof-of-reserves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>here</b></a>.</p>\n<h2>Proof of Assets</h2>\n<h5>Verified</h5>\n<p>Below please find an overview of the key wallet addresses used by Deribit. Please note, the list below does not include addresses of assets held in third-party custodians, like Copper Clearloop and Cobo Loop.</p>\n<h3>Verification of your Assets</h3>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Every day Deribit takes a snapshot of the on-chain assets for all eligible account. Assets held by third party custodians cannot be included in the reporting as they are not in Deribit’s direct control. The data file that is fully accessible for all interested parties therefore only contains the accounts that hold assets on Deribit.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img1\" src=\"https://insights.deribit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/owrngshd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"769\" height=\"413\" /></p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> In contrast to Maxwell’s approach, Deribit’s modified proof of assets includes steganography (rearranging balance data) of our user balances to protect client privacy and prevent disclosure of actual balances and their links to blockchain addresses or identities. This is important as we disclose a full list of accounts. Only the client can recognise his or her&#8217;s assets in the list.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> In the Deribit frontend (<a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/proof-of-reserves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b style=\"color: #1bcfbe;\">here</b></a>) clients will find a hash allowing them to verify that their assets are included in the asset file at both the main and sub-account level.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> All code used to create Deribit’s modified Merkle Tree is available below so clients can verify the accuracy of the frontend data. To prevent the same nonces being assigned to different users with comparable asset levels, thus reducing the size of liabilities, we give each account a unique Proof ID. Using the instructions below client can convert the Proof ID into the identifiers found in the daily Snapshot file and shown in the verification section of the <b style=\"color: #1bcfbe;\"><a style=\"color: #1bcfbe;\" href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/proof-of-reserves\"><span style=\"color: #1bcfbe;\">Proof</span> of <span style=\"color: #1bcfbe;\">Reserves</span> page</a></b>.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> <span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); color: var(--body_typography-color); font-family: var(--body_typography-font-family); font-size: var(--body_typography-font-size); font-style: var(--body_typography-font-style,normal); font-weight: var(--body_typography-font-weight); letter-spacing: var(--body_typography-letter-spacing);\">The aggregate of the assets included in the Asset File should always be less than the aggregate of assets available on-chain.

Liabilities\nVerified\nDeribit holds a 1:1 reserve of all customer assets and the company is happy to provide full transparency into our holdings. A cryptographic proof of liabilities, verifiable by any party without relying on a trusted auditor, was first proposed by Greg Maxwell in 2013, and is known as the Maxwell protocol.This initial proposal disclosed information about the number and size of customer accounts, which is why Deribit is using a slightly modified version that protects client privacy and offers full transparency, preventing balances from being hidden.\nDeribit constructed a binary Merkle hash overview with the leaves being the steganographed (cut in-pieces) balances of our individual users, broken up by asset. Clients can see exactly which leaves in the tree refer to their funds by using the unique hash built from their account information. With the individual liabilities established, it can be easily verified whether the aggregate of these liabilities is held by Deribit on-chain.\nThe daily snapshot file can be found here.\nProof of Assets\nVerified\nBelow please find an overview of the key wallet addresses used by Deribit. Please note, the list below does not include addresses of assets held in third-party custodians, like Copper Clearloop and Cobo Loop.\nVerification of your Assets\n1. Every day Deribit takes a snapshot of the on-chain assets for all eligible account. Assets held by third party custodians cannot be included in the reporting as they are not in Deribit’s direct control. The data file that is fully accessible for all interested parties therefore only contains the accounts that hold assets on Deribit.\n\n2. In contrast to Maxwell’s approach, Deribit’s modified proof of assets includes steganography (rearranging balance data) of our user balances to protect client privacy and prevent disclosure of actual balances and their links to blockchain addresses or identities. This is important as we disclose a full list of accounts. Only the client can recognise his or her’s assets in the list.\n3. In the Deribit frontend (here) clients will find a hash allowing them to verify that their assets are included in the asset file at both the main and sub-account level.\n4. All code used to create Deribit’s modified Merkle Tree is available below so clients can verify the accuracy of the frontend data. To prevent the same nonces being assigned to different users with comparable asset levels, thus reducing the size of liabilities, we give each account a unique Proof ID. Using the instructions below client can convert the Proof ID into the identifiers found in the daily Snapshot file and shown in the verification section of the Proof of Reserves page.\n5. The aggregate of the assets included in the Asset File should always be less than the aggregate of assets available on-chain. The difference is the Deribit reserve ratio, which includes the insurance funds and Deribit revenues. If the total on chain balance is higher than the Asset File balance (visible in frontend and in file itself), then Deribit has Proof of Reserves.\nUser Code\n1. User can find his or her Proof ID from the frontend. The user can verify their Proof ID is unique by performing the following steps:\n\nA. Verify Proof Signature\n– Get the User ID and Proof ID Signature from the Proof Of Reserves page\n– Download the latest Proof Of Reserves snapshot and copy the Public Key (public_key field in json file)\n– Use the Ed25519 signature algorithm to verify that the Proof ID Signature was used to sign the User ID\ntool: https://ed25519.altr.dev/ (Base64)\n– Message = User ID\n– Signature = Proof ID Signature\nB. Verify Proof ID\n– Base64url decode the Proof ID and Proof ID Signature\ntool: https://cryptii.com/pipes/base64-to-hex (Variant = Base64url, Format: Hexadecimal Group By = None)\n– Verify if sha1(Proof ID Signature Base64url Decoded) = Proof ID Base64url Decoded\ntool: https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha1.html (Input Type = Hex)\n\n2. By calculating hashes a user can fetch all his entries from the “liability” field of the JSON file (to increase PartNumber until no more fetches).

Everyone can check that our total liability (sum of all liability entries) is less than disclosed on-chain reserves (addresses see below).\n4. When total liability is less than or equal to the wallet reserves, it confirms that Deribit has provided Proof-of-Reserves as it is holding sufficient reserves. As the snapshots are taken daily, market volatility and the corresponding impact on customer portfolios may cause a temporary difference between snapshots.\nAdditional reserves (beyond liabilities)\nThe additional reserves (assets under Deribit’s control beyond client liabilities), or the Deribit reserve ratio, includes the Deribit insurance fund, Deribit’s daily revenues and accounts used for payments and general administration.\nAs Cobo Loop clients have the choice to withdraw assets via Cobo Loop or, Deribit will need to keep funds to facilitate direct withdrawals by Cobo Loop users. This is contrary to Copper Clearloop, where 100% of client assets are always held by Copper.\n(Proof of Margins) locked\nVerified\nFinally, Deribit publishes an endpoint that shows cumulative margin locked (MM and IM per currency) for the entire user base. This endpoint shows in real-time how many assets are held on Deribit as margins for outstanding positions. The above sections provides specifics on the exact assets Deribit holds on behalf of clients and how users can verify the assets exist, hence this enpoint is an additional layer of transparency.\nPlease see the following real-time endpoint here.\n\n.fusion-body .fusion-builder-column-2{width:100% !important;margin-top : 0px;margin-bottom : 20px;}.fusion-builder-column-2 > .fusion-column-wrapper {padding-top : 0px !important;padding-right : 0px !important;margin-right : 1.92%;padding-bottom : 0px !important;padding-left : 0px !important;margin-left : 1.92%;}@media only screen and (max-width:1024px) {.fusion-body .fusion-builder-column-2{width:100% !important;order : 0;}.fusion-builder-column-2 > .fusion-column-wrapper {margin-right : 1.92%;margin-left : 1.92%;}}@media only screen and (max-width:640px) {.fusion-body .fusion-builder-column-2{width:100% !important;order : 0;}.fusion-builder-column-2 > .fusion-column-wrapper {margin-right : 1.92%;margin-left : 1.92%;}}\n.fusion-body .fusion-flex-container.fusion-builder-row-3{ padding-top : 0px;margin-top : 30px;padding-right : 0px;padding-bottom : 0px;margin-bottom : 0px;padding-left : 0px;}\n\n\n@media only screen and (max-width:1024px) {.fusion-title.fusion-title-2{margin-top:0px!important; margin-right:0px!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:0px!important;}}@media only screen and (max-width:640px) {.fusion-title.fusion-title-2{margin-top:10px!important; margin-right:0px!important;margin-bottom:10px!important; margin-left:0px!important;}}\nDon’t Trust Us.

This is how I define ‘red flag.’”\nBut Nansen research analyst Niklas Polk cautioned against jumping to conclusions prematurely, making the distinction that FTX’s “blowup was not because people withdrew [money], but rather because they didn’t have the money” — due to Alamada’s fraudulent activity.  \nA worst case scenario from a bank run on Binance, he said, is that “liquidity dries up and people cannot convert to dollars, or withdraw all tokens to all chains.” ​​ \nA Binance told Blockworks in an email Tuesday that the company was preparing to offer proof of reserves for additional tokens.\n“Binance is committed to transparency and fostering trust in the ecosystem,” the representative added. “We will share more updates on other efforts when we have further details.”\nGet the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening. Subscribe to Blockworks’ free newsletter now.\nCan’t wait?
